143001,14349,Little Witch Academia,"['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Magic', 'Fantasy', 'School']",224526,470,696.0,8.0,"""Trigger saved anime."" This is a phrase the anime community got to read a lot alongside Kill la Kill's airing until a little while. I'd go this far and say that Trigger DID save anime. But it had nothing to do with Kill la Kill. Read here why! Actually, Little Witch Academia caught me by surprise. I didn't know Studio Trigger had something like that in stock and after I found out about this little gem I almost instantly decided to download it and oh boy was that a fine decision. Reminder: This review will be spoiler free and I will refrain from going too deep into happenings and just summarize it really, really quickly. We have the main heroine Akko Kagari. As a child she was attending a magic show featuring the witch Shiny Chariot who has become an idol for Akko. Even though she is not born into a magic family she attends the name giving magic school and is friends with Sucy and Lotte. Let's split up this review into the five categories as usual: Story (7/10): There really isn't much I can say about a one episode anime with 25 minutes without coming up with a summary or spoilers. So let's just say that Little Witch Academia features a coherent plot. It features a look in the past of the main character and her motivations, parts of the everyday life at the academy and the interactions between multiple different characters. It's just one episode but felt concluded and not rushed by any means. Art (7/10): Since it has been Studio Trigger working on this it has this certain touch you instantly get out of it if you have watched Kill la Kill before. In general the backgrounds are very nice to look at, the animation is fluid, lightning looks gorgeous and the character models are full of variety in looks and facial animations. There is nothing to complain about here. Sound (8/10): As it is a single episode anime yet I would have never thought so much effort has been pumped into the soundtrack. It was outstanding and had a broad variety of different tunes to set the mood. I really loved that it consisted mostly of orchestral music. It just fitted so well. Another part worth mentioning in the ""Sound""-category is the voice acting. Trigger got really, really talented people on board for Little Witch Academia and it was a pure pleasure listening to them. Character (8/10): For a one-piece show they had a pretty adorable and varying cast reaching from the arrogant but talented witch with her two friends and the goofy main character as well as her sidekicks which would be a clumsy glasses girl and the superficially more introverted girl with the not-so-obvious but kickass abilities. All in all a very good cast of likeable characters. Enjoyment (9/10): I can't remember when it was the last time 25 minutes felt that short. It was over in almost an instant and had no dull moments. It was funny, suspenseful and full of quality. Pure entertainment! Verdict (8/10*): A very good anime. It is nice to see that projects like Little Witch Academia are such a success (600.000 clicks on YouTube according to Trigger). Also the second episode has been an insane hit on Kickstarter, fulfilling the 150.000$ mark in just one day. I can't wait for more. It was fun all along. You shouldn't miss out on this enchanting tale! It's worth your very time and appreciation. --------------------------------- *) Score is not an average Helpful",3359,Positive,Positive,"Little Witch Academia praised for coherent plot, engaging characters, and nostalgic appeal.","{""sentiment"":""Positive"",""summary"":""Little Witch Academia praised for coherent plot, engaging characters, and nostalgic appeal.""}"

In the first few episodes, it was intriguing, and the story was progressing well. It presents a great deal of mystery and potential. The way the characters are introduced is clever, and each episode masterfully presents a captivating theme throughout, and ends with you desperately wanting to know what happens next. Sadly, as it moves on, and the harem aspect becomes more apparent, the story slowly dies. Instead of the action, fights, and moving moments, fan service becomes commonplace. As for character background, the only character with a fleshed out back story would be Kojou. The flashbacks and pieces of his memories seem to evidently hide huge secrets and momentous events, yet the series keeps a veil of secrecy over his past the entire while. As for the other characters, most lacked a back story entirely. Despite being liable to having an enthralling past, the anime seemed to be hesitant to touch on any of it, and when it does, it usually ends with one scene, and never progresses whatsoever. The animation, however, is very good. The movements of the characters don't seem clumsy or unnatural and action is generally fluid. The varying BGM is played at appropriate scenes, and enhances the overall feeling of the scene. Overall, a good series.

Since I'm (kinda) a young girl and not much of fan of harem stuff, I did roll my eyes at some fanservice moments, but other than that - WOW. It's like thousand times better than first series. Story gets much more complicated and Magic vs. Science 'fight' gets more serious. That's exactly what I like Also, less 'fillers' :D To sum' it all up - if you liked first season, you will LOVE this one. If you didn't like first season that much - well, you will still like this one. XD But if you loved first season aswell, then I really don't know why are you reading that XD Shoo, go watch it already! ~Art~ 9/10 Pretty animation, yes yes. It's clearly visible that more money was spent on 2nd season comapred to first. I took lots of screenshots because art is so nice.. The eyes, the hair, and...and....I looove how powers are drawn, like Misaka's electricity. :) ~Sound~ 9/10 If I say half of my MP3's full just with Index OSTs and openings/endings, doesn't that tell enough? As always, it's completely amazing :) Besides I'm huge fan of Mami Kawada and once again both openings are completely suiting for Index atmosphere - somewhere on youtube somebody wrote that Mami Kawada's songs always fit atmosphere perfectly, and I must agree. I never once skipped the opening since episode 17 xD ~Character~ 9/10 Well...poor Index is being ignored again XD And I miss Misaka - though I was watching Railgun parallely(is that even a word or I just invented it?) with it so I survived :3 However, I was really happy to get a little bit more of Accelerator and Last Order, also everybody besides Index gets development and all. They are great just as always. ~Enjoyment~ 10/10 There's where TAMNI didn't disappoint me nor in first season nor here.

30177,7655,Major S6,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Shounen', 'Sports']",41466,2136,175.0,9.0,"“The final course” The Story… Continuing the momentum from the beginning of this anime, S6 became the pinnacle of all the seasons. This is where being as a professional took place and done, a stage where honor and passion given away to fight over to be the only one on the top. Ambition, passion, and spirit like the preceding season never fade away as new encounters and obstacles being added to give some twist and tale to tell for a whole new season. With a whole new story to come up, this series gives the same essence like before while a new bunch of characters that will gather around not only for Goro but also with the situations and obstacles that he’ll face. While the past season is all about competitiveness and perseverance of two or more person, this time it gives a different perception on the series; for how it will turn to be in a professional league, the mechanics into it, and having strengths and weaknesses being on a team. A series where there are different tales about some characters that will be involved. Similar for what the past seasons have, it contains different emotions that will bring out the drama and spirit of a player. The flow of the story seems a bit off from what it has before because it focuses and maintains a balance feature of drama and sports action. Having a setting like that will not be boring to watch as it takes different emotions and scenes to consider. Even though, it still has the same competitive aspects but less impact as a whole. Art & Animation… It has the same method and style like before, but they focus more on scenery designs and effects of a particular scene. Having a refreshing and vibrant art gives more impact not only to the story but also to the characters involved. Both OP and ED theme have their own art and animation that is beautiful and touching as it depicts the meaning of the story. The characters are drawn in such fitted manner connecting to their appearance and attitudes in which we can easily tell the uniqueness among them. Also the animations here are just right for each actions and reactions on a particular scene. As a baseball park or even outside of it, we cannot disregard the minor details like the great lightings which help to maintain the clarity of a picture, and the people cheering and other extras that been sighted to be entertaining. All of them have a big role to the series for it to become more attractive, as it serves an additional factor of excitement and thrill. Sound… At the start of the series, hearing the song “Kokoro e” is quite reminiscing where they already used it as an OP song before. Hearing a song like that will surely come up to your senses, which from the start of the anime until now, you vividly followed the series. Although the rhythm of the ”Kokoro e” today was new, it never drops the essence of it to the story, and gradually helps to maintain a calm and catchy OP. In the ending, “Twilight Star” have a fast beat and energetic tune which is perfect because the series contains such thrill, excitement, and tension among players, while ""For Years..."" have a slow beat and harmonic tune which is also rhyme to the series because for years, remembering those moments, this is the time where all of those are being granted, thus, it adds an effect to the flow of the story. Having these OP and ED songs completely adds impact to the series The BGM and sounds inside and outside the field surely brings tension and thrill, for each of them will sway your emotions and excitement on what will happen next. Excitingly the cheering, reactions, and emotions being fired away was way above than the past couple of seasons, which this time, it totally adds a great impact to the story as well. Characters… New season means there are also new characters to be seen. Looking for the main protagonist of the story, which is Goro, with his stubbornness that always brings excitement and suspense to the show seems like to become quite a thinker and been more obedient. But one thing that still hasn’t gone into his trait is being aggressive all the time, always in a high spirit; giving all he got and never give up, and being a sportsman to its fellow player. On the side note that Goro is now in a professional baseball team, there are some of his teammates have done quite remarkable in the series. Murdoch has a fierce personality in physical and mental state; Watts, a senior and proved to be a leader of the team; Keane, a past teammate, and have been quite observant to the surroundings; nevertheless, the other teammates have done a great job supporting the team. With all of these characters, working alone with Goro’s instinct isn’t suitable for his current team, while all his teammates also achieving its only goal. By adding new characters that blends to the story and situations turns more like a true scenario which they adopt, but the fiery ambition around it seems to be reduced while keeping it balanced with the drama instead. Now that Goro proves that he can outmatch any batter, it looks like most of his rivals might fade away, which may affect on the heat towards the series. With such characters in the series, it creates a mixture of different personalities as the focus will be varied on the situation. In the end, the essence still remains while maintaining a balanced and exciting feature. Overall & Enjoyment… This season becomes more established by stabilizing the sports action, drama, and its essence. This might be not as fiery as its preceding, but it’s more like having a variation of emotions and actions of different characters involved. Along with a mixture of elements such as sounds and art, it makes a big contribution, which affects and energizes the whole situation or events within the series. Having all this elements balanced out, Goro still makes a persistent attitude that will enchant most of the viewers. All in all the series may give a different level of excitement along with the effects and animation towards its story. **Watch the prequels to maximize the enjoyment and understanding about the story.

What stands out in Touch is the outstanding character development, which makes you really like them, specially Tatsuya. The pace of this develpment is really slow, which helps to see a lot of details on their personality. The relationship between him and his two best friends (his brother Katsuya and Minami, their childhood friend) also makes you not want Touch to end. The way they push each other foward and how differently they respond to these incentives plays the most important part of the story. There are ups and downs. There is no denying that the third part (coach sunglasses) is a tad below the rest of the anime. But for a series with 100 episodes this is really good. Baseball parts are well made and gives you the feel of the game. One of the best addition of sports into an anime ever. It helps that baseball has a lot of pauses, so it doesn't look stupid when the players are really thinking during the matches. The love triangles that appear along the series help to make it a good ""slice of life"" anime, which I'd recommend to anyone.

Yu Yu Hakuso is a show that avoids a lot of cliches that are in other Shounen anime like Dragon Ball Z, Naruto, One Piece, etc. Shounen anime are often filled with filler, gigantic casts full of simple characters, inconsistency in quality of animation, tournament arcs, and slow pacing. Dragon Ball Z, was a huge part of my childhood and I will always love it, and I have a soft spot for Shounen stuff in general, but I am not about to defend them and their numerous flaws. Luckily, Yu Yu Hakusho manages to avoid almost all of the flaws that typically befall this kind of show. Yu Yu Hakusho has a smaller cast of characters that are much more well developed, consistently good animation (that holds up despite being 20 years old), a much faster pace, and a story that has actual stakes. All of other Shounens, like Fairy Tail or One Piece, are extremely light hearted and have very little stakes. Yu Yu Hakuso is also a bit darker and a bit more unpredictable than most other Shounen. Yu Yu Hakusho does have a tournament arc, and the blend of action and comedy you either love or hate about Shonen anime, but I think those are the parts of Shounen anime we all usually like. Side note, the Dub is great and probably one of the most under rated Dubs around. Yu Yu Hakusho avoids almost all the negative cliches typically found in shows of this genre, while providing some great characters, well animated action, plenty of humor, plenty of bad ass moments, and a really entertaining adventure.

16932,4884,Tales of the Abyss,"['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Fantasy']",100616,1088,2220.0,9.0,"Now, I should mention first that I have not played the Tales of the Abyss video game on which this anime is based. Despite that, I found it a great series to watch, with excellent characters and character development, brilliantly animated scenes, spectacular artwork, and a well-paced excellent story. The story starts out slowly, but each character gives the viewer an immediate impression when introduced and one quickly develops feelings towards him or her, whether good or bad. Each character is developed to the fullest extent, with detailed backstories, distinct personalities, personal motivation and conflicts, and excellent designs. You can truly feel the conflicts they experience, and the depth they get into is truly spectacular. The antagonists are as well-developed as the protagonists, and since their development is on the same level, when conflict does arise, it’s felt much more forcefully since you don’t know which side has more willpower to win the ensuring battles. The development is especially strong for Luke, and just seeing him undergo his transformation throughout the series is breathtaking. Also, all the characters just mesh in with each other extremely well, and the chemistry amongst everyone is well-done, again, both protagonists, secondary characters, and antagonists. The animation, like the characters, is wonderful, with fluid movements and flashy attacks. Pair that up with colorful drawings and excellent backgrounds and scenes, and scenes exceed my expectations. It even gives the .hack series a run for the money in this aspect. The pacing helps get the animation and drawings noticed, since there are moments where it’s slow enough to admire the drawings and detail work woven into the scenes, but it’s not too slow so that you get bored and drift off. There is enough action mixed into each mission to keep the pace up, plus good dialogue amongst the characters. Unfortunately, there is a flaw in the dialogue in that the vocabulary often used is difficult to comprehend, and many references are made to these words. Explanations are given for the vocabulary and what the world is like, but having not played the games is a bit disadvantageous, since the explanations are long and require pausing, rewatching, and analysis before one understands it. What’s offered in the anime is just a fast-placed blurb and a quick picture where you have about 5 seconds to absorb all the information. Thus, without pausing, it limits the viewer’s degree of plot comprehension. I’m sure those who have played the games will be able to enjoy and understand the series without pausing and thinking for this kind of comprehension. Despite having to take a little more time to understand some of the terminology in Tales of the Abyss, I do think the series is well worth the time. Even if you haven’t played the games, the series is very enjoyable. Great characters, good plotline, fantastic drawings and animations await those who watch Tales.

274705,34798,Yuru Camp△,"['Slice of Life', 'Comedy']",209936,521,228.0,10.0,"I love the Japanese landscape in real life. So a show featuring it is a must-see for me by this merit alone. This anime is far exceeding my and perhaps anybody's expectation. Perhaps the first hint of it being a hit was the VA's list: Touyama Nao, one of the three ""magicians"" VAs highly praised by the Chinese (the other two are Taneda Risa and Sakura Ayane). Toyosaki Aki, the Yui in K-On! and a member of Sphere. Apart from them, nothing else was really eye-catching at first glance. But the opening with Rin riding her bike along the road towards Motosuko in Autumn Japan was already a treat. Japan is really that beautiful - an industrial country still spotted with pristine landscape. And the show knows it and capitalizes on it. It alternates camping site for camping site in the late Japanese autumn. It was a good change since most audience were quite exposed to the Sakura Japanese Spring by many other animes (Shigatsu wa kimi no uso, Hyouka and on and on). Red sugar maple trees with other golden trees lined up the shores of Shibireko in ep 6 & 7 were breathtaking. One of the best episodes, the Chinese and Japanese crown it with ""神回"" (godlike episode), is ep. 5. The outside Hottokeya onsen with a view over Yamanashi city was a killer. 40°C water, the best weather, under the most relaxing music, the girls just were submerging themselves in all these- Nadeshiko summed it up ""極楽、極楽"" (heavenly comfort, heavenly comfort). On the parallel side, Rin's repeating ""温泉！温泉！温泉！"" just makes the whole thing more comforting. Then it comes to camping and finally the sweet night photo scene - Nadeshiko sent Rin a photo of Yamanashi while Rin sent Nadeshiko a shot of the picturesque Suwa lake, all under orginal music with the title ""高ボッチ、イーストウッド"" (the names of two camping sites). Especially when Rin took her shot, the uplifting background music with a female voice chanting in it was just pure gold. This is an anime, where the joy for camping, the awe in front of the night scenery and the quiet environment are all there. But it is also an anime about friendship among our 5 heroines. They were happy camping because they had each other. Even in ep. 1 which looked like a Rin's solo, it was only heating up after Nadeshiko's joining. And ever since then, the fun of camping had never been the same: culminating in episodes 3, 5, 7 and the last two, all with Nadeshiko. The pacing of the anime was also special. It followed a A-B-A-B-A rhythm, where a camping episode was followed by an intermission (traveling, planning and shopping) so that we didn't get too much a camping overdose and didn't soon lose our appetite. Without a question, the camping episodes were the highlights, but we would have enjoyed them slightly less if it those filler episodes weren't there. Also the educational aspect of the show is refreshing. Ootsuka Akio voiced the narrative insert with quite a humor sense. The music OP+ED+OST is perhaps one of the most anticipated of the season. The OP is high-spirited song that kicked open most of the episodes. While the OST and the EP are just max comfying. The OST, played with whistles, string instruments and guitars, is just delivering everything we need for the show and then some. I believe that many viewers around the world, me included have thoroughly enjoyed this show so very much. It will be perhaps some years away for a season 2. But let's just wait.

915,345,Eikoku Koi Monogatari Emma,"['Slice of Life', 'Historical', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'Seinen']",37103,2281,1092.0,9.0,"Title: Victorian Romance Emma Manga/Novels: Victorian Romance Emma began as a manga by self-professed Anglophile Kaori Mori, and ran in Monthly Comic Beam from August 30th, 2002 to April 12th, 2006. The manga won an Excellence Prize at the Japan Media Arts Festival in 2005. CMX has licensed the manga Stateside, and the fourth of eight volumes was released June 20th of this year. The manga has ended its run in Japan, but Kaoru Mori continues to publish side stories (known as Emma Bangaihen), and is set at eleven side stories, the ninth of which was released recently. The manga is known to have something of a cult following and apparently has an Emma-inspired/themed caf&Atilde;&copy; in Shibuya to it's name. Saori Kumi has also done novel adaptations of the manga, and two volumes were released in 2005. The anime was done by Studio Perrot (famous for Bleach, Midori no Hibi and Blood+) and directed by Tsuneo Kobayashi (who also directed The Twelve Kingdoms), and ran on TV from April 2nd, 2005 to June 18th, 2005. The Right Stuf International announced its Stateside licensing of Emma and it's second season (Victorian Romance Emma: The Second Act, which is not covered in this review) on June 30th, and plans to release it solely with subs and in a box set; a release date has not been announced at this time. Story: The story kicks off with William Jones, a member of the gentry, visiting his old governess unexpectedly. Because he stands almost right in front of the door, he gets knocked off his feet (literally and figuratively) by the governess' maid, Emma, when she opens the door. And I'm betting that you can probably guess what happens based on the series' title, albeit with some added angles. But one of the many things that makes this series stand out is the slow pacing of the romance. For some, it's going to be agonizingly slow (it takes William half the series to offer to take her out somewhere, and just over that for him to actually do so and kiss her while he's at it, which, at that point, is considered leaps and bounds), but for me, it's just right, especially with the sweetness and fluffiness of it all. I guarantee that you will be grinning like an idiot as you watch it develop. With regards to faithfulness to its manga source: I've only got the first volume of the series to my name at this point in time, but from what I saw, the series was extremely faithful to the source, down to the angles of certain scenes. Another thing that makes me absolutely adore this series is the way that the series invests you in every single one of the characters. It's a rare series that actually makes you feel - really, honestly care -- for characters that are clearly supposed to be &quot;in the way&quot;. One of the best examples of this is Elanor, a girl of the gentry who is clearly meant to be &quot;the other woman&quot;, and one of the the odd ones out in the triangle... square... thingy. But you honestly feel sorry for her, because she's just as much in love with William as he and Emma are with each other, and it's her first love, and it just absolutely sucks that it's unrequited on her end, and that she's clearly wasting her time with William. And the way that it does Emma's past would have seemed Sue-ish and annoying in any other show, but doesn't here. But the thing that makes this series absolutely shine is the historical accuracy. Apparently, Kaoru Mori hired a historical consultant (Rico Murakami) from the third volume of the manga on to ensure accuracy; Murakami was also hired for the anime, and it shows. The subs I watched also included little historical notes at the end of each episode to explain unfamiliar/obscure things to the average viewer. Murakami and Mori released a companion guide (Emma Victorian Guide) that does the same thing. And this historical accuracy holds, even in the resolution of the show. Shoujo diehards are probably going to absolutely hate the ending (don't worry; there's the second season if you dislike the ending that much), because it doesn't hold to shoujo standards. But you know what? After how historically accurate the series was, it wouldn't have seemed right for things to turn out any other way. Art: This is one of the places where faithfulness to the manga holds. Pierrot's animation, which is beautiful in and of itself, is barely different at all from the art style that Kaoru Mori used in the manga. As such, it's just like watching the manga come to life in front of your eyes. Even details down to the angle of certain scenes from the manga hold, which makes seeing your favorite scenes from the manga that much more awesome. Music: Emma has a unique OP and ED, in that none of them have any vocals to them; it's all just instrumentals. But the thing is that they're still very memorable, even without lyrics. I prefer the OP (which is so calming that I've been using to get to sleep lately) over the ED (which sounds fairly circus-y). The music for the series itself consists of a lot of variations on the OP and ED, but has its share of original music, too. And every bit of it is beautiful, especially in the way that it uses strings and piano. And I'd be willing to bet that every bit of it could easily fit in the Victorian Period. Seiyuu: There aren't any particular standout roles in this series, but on the other hand, there aren't any that suck terribly. Just a fairly standard set of voices. No problems on my end. Dub: N/A Length: Twelve episodes seems like a perfect length for this series. There's not any push to rush the series along, and it doesn't plod along, even though the story goes at a slower pace than most series. It's at just the right pace. For those who didn't like the ending, or want more Emma, there is the second season that I've mentioned throughout this review (Victorian Romance Emma: The Second Act). However, know going into it that subs only go up to the ninth episode, because of its licensing. Overall: This is far from your standard shoujo series.

The slower pacing of the episodes and the romance feels just right, and the faithfulness to the manga source in story and art style are a real treat. The music and seiyuu add the icing on the cake.

I was enamored with the series from the get-go, and that fascination only deepened with time. It's a brilliant, one-of-a-kind piece of art that definitely will stay with you for a long time. The story is divided into 5 separate arcs, all happening at undisclosed, scattered points in time and in unrelated locations, each however involving the Medicine Seller as a hunter and slayer of a different demon -- a Mononoke. His process, or M.O. if you will, comprises of getting to the root of the Mononoke's ""form"", ""truth"", and finally, ""regret"" (or ""reason"", the translations vary on this one). Knowing all of those allows him then to draw his magical sword and kill the demon dead. As far as personal opinions go, I think I enjoyed the three middle stories the most; the third one (Noppera-bō) was probably my favorite of all of them. No details though -- wouldn't want to spoil a thing. What makes this series most outstanding is its use of visuals and sounds as a means to induce very particular moods. Since this is supernatural horror we're talking about, there's a perpetual feeling of unease in the air, and boy, does it make your skin crawl at times. (There are humorous elements as well, and those do take you by surprise, strangely only adding up to the comedy.) Listen, it's not enough to say the colors are beautiful -- virtually each shot is worthy of putting it in a frame and hanging it somewhere... which would however, now that I think about it, take a lot away from the *animated* aspect of the sheer beauty in so many of these scenes. So I take that back. The shaking frames combined with the crazy saturation AND the creepy, abrupt sound effects give way to something entirely unusual and enchanting altogether. Characters are built wonderfully, with each individual arc, short as it is, allowing the viewer to get to know each backstory and judge its protagonist individually. The Medicine Seller himself is a largely mysterious figure who just materializes in different locations and most of the time, speaks in riddles (the man also loves his dramatic pauses). But all of it makes sense in its own way. It's just... too bad there's no more than a mere 12 episodes of this. Whatever way you look at it, this series is an Experience, capital E.

60873,135,Hikaru no Go,"['Comedy', 'Game', 'Shounen', 'Supernatural']",96999,1130,389.0,4.0,"Hikaru no Go was a long running manga written by Hotta Yumi in the late 90s, early 2000s. Of course, it got an anime adaptation. I'll be honest, it's an anime based off of a board game. I don't see much possibility of it being good or interesting. Will it surprise me? Let's take a look at the anime and find out. Our story begins with a boy with ridiculous, multi-coloured hair, Shindou Hikaru, going through his grandfather's garage. He comes across an old Go board with a stain that only he can see. The ghost of a Go player named Sai from ancient times emerges and inhabits a corner of his mind. All Sai desires is to play Go and, being unable to do anything on his own, he quickly drags Hikaru into the game. Hikaru quickly gains an interest in playing and decides to become a professional Go player. The story is pretty boring. There are no real stakes and it lacks any real tension since all they're doing is playing a board game. They try to make up for it with absurd levels of melodrama, but that only makes the story stupid in addition to being boring. Everything also moves far too slowly. I nearly fell asleep on several occasions while watching episodes just because nothing remotely interesting was happening. They could have finished the series in half the time without all the bloody padding. The series could have been interesting if the characters were capable of carrying the premise. Unfortunately, the characters are really flat. You don't know anything about most of them aside from one or two minor pieces of information. Most of them rely on cliche personalities and just come across as stale. To make matters worse, Hikaru is an insufferable brat and Sai spends a great deal of his time whining. Neither one is well fleshed out or even sympathetic. The art ranges from fine to sub-par. Most of the time it does its job but characters tend to have borked faces and random motion lines get added to the Go games in a failed attempt at creating excitement. Frankly, the art looks more like it was done in the late 80s than the early 2000s. The voice acting is pretty standard. No one does an outstanding job but there's no one who does horribly either. The music is the best part of the series and even it isn't great. It's just decent. The yuri factor is a 1/10. There are some female characters in minor roles but you barely see them interact and they certainly don't have developed enough relationships to be able to identify what kind of relationships they share aside from a very general ""friendly."" My final rating for Hikaru no Go is a 4/10. You might enjoy it if you're a massive fan of professional Go, but even that's unlikely given the boring story, bland characters, dull art and uninspired voice acting. You'd think that watching the games might be enough for Go fans, but you don't even see enough of the Go games to get invested in them or to be able to tell how they went aside from knowing who's winning. The end result is a sub-par series.

I really wanted to like this movie because it was based on a manga by Hideyuki Kikucho who also wrote Vampire Hunter D. You can see the similarities in the animation (which is superb for its time,) supernatural themes and mysterious, romanticized character of Darkside. Unfortunately, the movie did not live up to the D. Call me dense, but I never did understand Darkside's power or why he was at odds with the Persona corporation. Had he not been a part of the movie, the story would have been complete--an oppressed society rising up against its oppressor. In fact, the most explored characters are the terrorist and the Kabuki-cho resident that nurses and shelters him. Where the anime does excel is the music. In the opening sequence, a street musician breaks out in a blues number during a struggle against Persona. The blues music portrays the heavy air of oppression in Kabuki-cho.

195115,21925,Chichiiro Toiki,['Hentai'],8602,4627,,10.0,"Hentai is always fappable when it's vanilla and lighthearted...or is it? Vanilla is always enjoyable because both parties are happy and both are enjoying themselves throughout. However, is it really? Can you say for sure? Chichiiro Toiki has proven me quite an interesting aspect of what hentai can actually achieve. The sound quality and voice acting are top notch. I don't think anything else can be said about the sound so lets get moving. The characters are as shallow as they are but the characters are deep enough to have the hentai be enjoyable overall. The characters (two girls) are your usual lighthearted females that easily forgive the Main character. Nothing can really be said besides the fact that they are really likable (like all Vanilla hentai). One of the most noticeable facet of this hentai is its animation. The animation is really smooth. Although the animation is smooth, because of the budget, the smoothness likely sacrificed the duration of the hentai (to specifically 15 minutes) . This trade off might seem unreasonable but the shortened duration also brought upon art that is extremely outstanding. The art is doubtlessly the best I've seen from a hentai so far. Yet, with its vanilla, smooth animation and great art, it has two great flaws that made this hentai partly not fappable. Although subjective, I believe Hentai's greatness lies in its story (albeit mostly shallow) and its art. The ideal situation from the story that kindles our lust and the details of the art that causes us to think we are present in the event are what creates a vivid and satisfying feeling. However, this hentai lacks one of the two. What might it be...? The art. This hentai went for the stars, it went beyond to achieve great art but because of that, it met its downfall. The art of the first episode was clear, the eyes of the character also have great detail. Nothing was really wrong with the first episode. The main problem lies in the second episode where the art was beyond expectation. The art is on par with that of anime created from studios of great renown. I believe the director wanted to define the mood ever more so clearly with the colors and art on the second episode. However, it became a piece of art that lacks detail that we want. The second episode of Chichiiro Toiki lacks the details of the characters. Their physical features are lost in the colors that represent the feelings of the characters and the surroundings. The episode can easily speed up the heartbeat of one, but the episode cannot speed up the blood up to the shaft even though the increased heartbeat supposedly should provide more blood to the body. I can say this once and I can say it once more, the art is so resplendent, to a point that it becomes more than your run of the mill hentai, it becomes a hentai that covets the viewer to find a meaning. I imagine the only word that can describe this flaw is ""Fabulous"". The second flaw is of trivial matter but I feel that I must voice my feelings for the readers of this review. The transitions of the second episode was severely lacking. One scene contains characters pretty heated in their actions but the next scene unexpectedly contain something else. To put it simply, the scenes sometimes feel abrupt. Many hentai tend to do that but it's done in a way that cannot be noticed. As I said before, it's quite trivial but It was on my mind so it's best to let one know. Another scene that quite irked me was when the Main male character generated white organic matter onto his partner's face. The next scene then has no trace of that whatsoever. The organic matter disappeared without a trace, maybe it was consumed off screen, who knows... Now, let me answer that very question that started this whole review: Hentai is not always fappable when it's vanilla and lighthearted, because the art can be unexpected and in this case, unexpectedly fabulous.

There's no need for another one but heck, I'll just go ahead and write one any way. :D I think Ouran High School Host Club is one of the most original stories I have come across. The main lead Haruhi and the other Host Club members are so three-dimensional and well explored in the entire anime. This is one of the best shoujo anime/manga in existence (if I am not wrong).

That was something hard to miss out on. I think the entire story and settings are meant to be satirical. Haruhi is an awesome female character.

13254,962,Aria The Natural,"['Fantasy', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen', 'Slice of Life']",55860,1754,332.0,9.0,"The problem with sequels is that they're rarely as good as the original, any show that actually achieves the feat of surpassing the original appears only once in a blue moon. Given that fact, I will freely admit that I approached Aria: the Natural with a certain degree of trepidation, especially as the original series is a favourite of mine. Thankfully, all of my fears were removed in the gentlest manner possible. Aria: the Natural continues the tale of Neo Venezia in very much the same manner as the original, except for the fact that this series is twice as long. The story, once more, revolves around Akari, Aika and Alice as they go through their daily lives in their ""quest"" to become undines. The episodic format of the original series is maintained throughout this one, and the show generally manages to achieve the same relaxed feeling of the original. However, Aria: The Natural has some moments that purists would define as ""off-kilter"" - a view I tend to disagree with. Let me explain. The first series was very much an introductory show, allowing the audience to familiarise themselves with Akari, Aika and Alice, as well as the other residents of Neo Venezia. The Natural, on the other hand, is an introduction to the world of Aqua itself, something which was alluded to in the final episode of the first series. Indeed, the role of cats in this series is much greater than before, and the quasi-supernatural element of the show, which was only lightly touched upon previously, is very much in force here. Because of this though, many people view The Natural as inferior to the original series, basing such judgement solely on the fact that this show has some genuinely creepy moments, as well as the fact that several episodes are based purely on supernatural events. In Aria: The Animation, the effect of the supernatural was toned down to maintain the relaxed feeling of the show, however The Natural pushes this aspect of Aqua firmly to the fore with the introduction of several elements - Cait Sith being the primary one. Art and animation for The Natural remains as superlative as the original, with some improvement given to some of the more ""fantastic"" plot elements. Character designs remain unchanged though (which will come as a relief to many fans), with each of the leads and the supporting roles being as visually charming as ever - even in Super Deformed mode. The panoramic views of the Neo Venezia remain very much in force, however these have been enhanced more because of the attention given to other areas of Aqua. The level of detail is actually better in The Natural because of the show's focus on the world of Aqua, and with that attention to detail comes a degree of personality (yes, I know it sounds weird saying that a world has personality - watch the show and see for yourself). Sound and music continue to be excellent, with the voice actors doing sterling work with their respective characters. The thematic music used throughout the series is very much in keeping with the style of the original series, and retains the same ""continental"" feeling as well. The sound effects are again, excellent and well choreographed, with nothing too overwhelming or too subtle. The OP and ED are calm and melodic, keeping the fluidly relaxed theme of both the original and this series. The characters are, again, a joy to watch, however some people may not follow this train of thought because of the supposed ""flaws"" in the show (i.e. the supernatural elements I mentioned earlier). Akari, Aika and Alice continue to be as charming and as innocent as ever, and while there may be a distinct lack of major development in this series, I didn't find this factor to hinder my appreciation of the characters in any way. The supporting characters continue to be by turns witty, soothing, stern, downright hilarious, etc, very much in keeping with the original series. However, many of the supporting cast tend to take more of a back seat in this series, with a greater amount of focus being given to Akari especially. Fans of the original series may not find that The Natural sits too well with them, especially given the fact that this show is less about the characters and more about the world they live in. That said, it continues to be a truly enjoyable series overall, and a truly relaxing one at that. Aria: The Natural, whilst maintaining everything that made the original series great, is actually a very different show, and I would judge it at least equal to The Animation in every aspect. Given the basis of The Natural, and its intorductory perspective on the world of Aqua, it's no surprise that fans recommend watching both series before watching Aria: The Origination.

Those who could be just as easily portrayed as one dimensional enemies, are all the same nuanced and complex with their own agendas and own feelings that can and do shine through. But that is not the only area in which Yamato 2199 is worthy of credit. Yet in addition to its compelling plot, the developments of all cast members over the duration of the show was a true pleasure to watch. It is very rare that you are able to see characters grow and change as clear as you can see within Yamato 2199. Relationships are brought to bloom, friendships form, struggle and then are rekindled. Diplomacy occurs and new ground is made. Tackling all these interpersonal plot lines and developments is undoubtedly a hefty challenge for director Akihiro Enomoto or so one might expect, but if it is, he does not show it. Assisting in this challenge is the voice cast of 2199, with whom great acting is done. Still, even in addition to all, that the art portrayed in the show is beautiful and doesn’t use an excess of CGI or other computer aided art in order to placate budget concerns, as is a pitfall of many other competing Space Opera anime such as Knights of Sidonia. Things like the ships, the planets, and the settings are all meticulously designed and executed, but even when it comes down to the appearance of weapons such as lasers and space torpedoes, it's just as believable as any other show of 2012. Not to be mistaken, CGI is certainly used and this can be considered a knock against the show, but it’s well advised for audiences to look over that fact thanks to the tasteful way that it was blended in with lush environments and fast paced, engaging action scenes. Because even if you consider that, all characters in the show are drawn lovingly and not rendered, with eye catching character designs that just further add to the relatability of the characters. You feel a part of their own struggles as an audience to Yamato 2199, and that’s a particular finesse that is very hard for most shows to capture. 2199 is not most shows. And here in the end, that is the greatest point of Space Battleship Yamato. It isn't like other shows because it captures a different type of humans- Yamato 2199 paints an exceedingly human depiction of real, adult struggle against the odds, people holding fast together to accomplish something that seems unthinkable. It mirrors us in our own struggles against any number of trials, and that's great. Amidst the washing sea of countless seasonal anime depicting Japanese high schoolers do any number of miraculous things, here presented by Studio AIC is a refreshing take of regular, heroic people taking up the mantle of humans just trying to survive. And in Yamato is all the accompanies of that very mantle-- the excitement, discovery, disappointment, the failures of people doing what they think is right, love, hate, camaraderie, and hard won success. It's all there, and that is what makes Space Battleship Yamato 2199 a great watch. Thank you for reading.

312219,36619,Shi Wan Ge Leng Xiaohua Movie 2,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Parody', 'Fantasy']",131,14763,13797.0,9.0,"I had a bit of a falling out with U17 Comics a few years back due to their new VIP policy, so I didn’t get around to watching this movie until yesterday. But damn, it brought back so many memories! First off, I’m going to say that a series like Shi Wan Ge Leng Xiao Hua (lit translation: 100 Thousand Bad Jokes, abbreviation: Shi Leng/十冷) cannot be objectively rated. The reason is that the main premise rests on humor, specifically in making parodies out of anything and everything. From traditional fables like the Honest Woodcutter, to classic children’s cartoons like Hu Lu Xiong Di, to popular Japanese anime like Detective Conan and One Piece, I don’t think I’ve seen anything that’s not been poked fun at in some way, shape, or form. Oh and if course there’s always the occasional stab at mainland Han Chinese stereotypes of the dialects/accents of other ethnic groups, which...well just remember that it’s all meant to be interpreted in a humorous light. Now, on to the actual review. Story: Very simple and straightforward. The main objective of the protagonist is to bring back the creator’s staff from the hands of the Southern God who stole it, in order to stop the war brewing between the other three gods. For this endeavor, he is accompanied by a band of three misfits who at times make things more challenging for him. A few straightforward plot twists are inserted along the way, such that the ending, while certainly expected, still holds some interesting surprises. Thus I give it 8/10. Art: Compared to the original series that aired one 5-minute episode on the first day of every month back in 2012, there’s been a massive amount of improvement. I’d say the animation is even better than the first Shi Leng movie, as the characters’ movements tend to be less stiff. Of course there’s always room for improvement, and while the galactic setting certainly allows room for stunning visuals involving massive spaceships and destructive weapons, there may have been a little too much CGI for my tastes. Later on in the series, there is a part where the art breaks down to just uncolored base sketches and in my opinion it’s one of my favorite deconstructions ever so I’m adding a bonus point in the art category for this. My score is 7+1 = 8/10. Sound: As expected, very solid voice acting. We see a lot of Tu Cao/吐槽 moments, in which one of the more levelheaded/reliable characters freaks out and spews out a massive string of comments about how nonsensical some of the other characters’ actions are. Without the talented VAs this series would not even have 1/4 of its appeal, so this is definitely a strong department. The music/sound effect side is a little bit weaker, mostly because there were so many random insert songs that, while meant for humor, weren’t always the most humorous. My score is 8/10 (average between 9/10 voice acting and 7/10 background sound). Character: This second movie saw the introduction of some new characters like Athena (pun for Argon Iodine Sodium) and Thor, and the return of some fan favorites like Xiao Jin Gang and the River God. All the characters have very quirky personalities that, when thrown together, create endearingly hilarious dynamics. I really like how each of them showcases his/her own strengths at some point in the series (the River God especially, I love him so much more now you have no idea). For a perfect 10, I would’ve like to see a little more character development (I also don’t really like how Athena was portrayed), but I think I can give a solid 8/10 in this category. Enjoyment: Hands down 10/10. I laughed the whole time. I think that’s a good sign that the movie lived up to its standards and did what it was supposed to do. In summary, I give the series 9/10 overall, because while there are some pitfalls the strengths far outweigh them. Case in point: I’m always impressed by the way they insert all those sponsored advertisements in a way that adds to rather than detracts from the humor. I’m sure by now if anyone is still reading this incomprehensible monstrosity you’re probably wondering “do you recommend the movie to me”. If you’re a hardcore Shi Leng fan like I once was, I’d say definitely yes. Don’t get turned off by the slightly unfamiliar cast of characters like I was - I promise you that everything will make perfect sense at the end (and, while it’s nice to have a big Nao Dong, you don’t need quantum physics to understand it!). If you’re unfamiliar to the series, I still think this movie can be very enjoyable as a stand-alone comedy to watch on a gloomy evening. You may not catch all the jokes, but there’s enough universal content in there that it should still be pretty funny.

It was well worth watching, with realistic drama and several surprise twists! As others have said, the story line is dramatic and interesting. There is some magical/super advanced technology used, but not too much to overly-distract from the central story. While I did enjoy the development of each of the characters' romantic interests in each other - and the resulting competitive clashes, I give this story deductions for the following reasons: - The romances began before enough character development was done, so the audience did not fully understand the motivations of the lead characters before the affinities began shifting. Also, - while the girls' feelings were explored in great depth, the boys personalities were portrayed much more one-dimensionally, with not nearly enough character development for the viewer to full understand the why they made the choices they make.

The art is breathtaking, the world vibrant and futuristic and most importantly, it felt like a breathing living piece of work that is both comedic and touching They included a diverse cast with their own unique distinct design and lifestyle. My dislike in the first episode only lasted a short brief moment and as they cut to different cast and the music starts playing, I fell in love with the premise of two young girls of completely different backgrounds finding each other by chance to what is mostly a perfect friendship. I say mostly because they had a short fight in the end that felt rather rushed and short. It didn't feel like they overcome much of anything as it was resolved off screen it feels like and ends quickly. I'm a big fan of angst and their friendship is wonderful but it feels forced (the fight that is). This entire show feels like an ode to friendship and music. Relationships in general, of the people who you work with, become acquaintances of - it was all touching, subtle and beautiful. I'm not much of a reviewer but while the story at times got a bit random and I can't tell much of a character development to our protagonists and that not all the music are amazing, they're all beautiful, there is beauty in imperfections and this attempt is worth the watch is my recommendation It's also I think the first show I've ever felt like immediately rewatching again just to hear and see the show in a different lens as someone who already knows how the journey goes, it feels like a beautiful orchestrated show poured with love by the animators and writers and of course voice actors and everyone else in the staff I'm also incredibly in awe of how the LGBT community is normalised for the most part and that they blend in so well with this world, it's the first show where I'm happy if our two protagonists Carole and Tuesday either stays as friends or something more - their relationship is adorable either way and I can't wait for the upcoming part two!

157135,19,Monster,"['Drama', 'Horror', 'Mystery', 'Police', 'Psychological', 'Seinen', 'Thriller']",459710,159,46.0,4.0,"Monster is touted as a masterpiece of the psychological thriller genre, boasting some of the greatest characters you'll find in an anime, and a story that is close to unrivaled in the medium. I think of Death Note as quite possibly the most genius story ever executed in television, film, or text, and no show is mentioned in the same breath as Ohba's masterwork more than Monster. While I wasn't going into this series expecting something quite of that caliber, I was expecting a great deal of suspense, top-notch dialogue, and, what I expect from every series I take the time to watch, a fulfilling ending. While there certainly were strong points in the show, enough to justify watching the entire run, I was let down largely on the first two counts, and entirely on the third. I'll start with the characters. As you would expect of a show that runs for 74 episodes, the number of faces you'll become familiar with is significant. That said, no long-running show I can think of develops seemingly inconsequential characters like Monster. My favorite supporting characters include Rosso, Braun, Reichwein, Martin, Gillen, Müller, and the best character the show has to offer, Wolfgang Grimmer. My favorite characters tend to be the main protagonist or antagonist, Lelouch from Code Geass, Light from Death Note, Edward Elric from Fullmetal Alchemist, but here I think Grimmer shined brighter than Dr. Tenma and Johan. I wish I could say that had everything to do with his appeal, but it was also a symptom of my disappointment with both of the primary characters. I felt bad for Dr. Tenma, and wanted him to regain his freedom, but almost more on an intellectual level than an emotional one. This is a problem I had throughout the show. I got where characters were coming from, but the emotional attachment wasn't there. Most every character familiar with Johan described him as a 'monster', as 'pure evil', and there were even some expecting that he'd be the next Adolf Hitler. Psychopaths realized what he was at first glance. He had an uncanny ability to bend anyone to his will. His power and greatness were unquestioned. This was the case from the start, but I can't say I ever truly bought into it. Again, on an intellectual level, I can look at his resume and realize he's a threat to humanity that must be erased, but I never really felt it. And, given that the show revolves entirely around his life, my overall enjoyment of the show was handicapped by my relative apathy regarding it's title character. While he did have some of the most impressive lines, I found myself hating Lunge, the Baby, Roberto, and Eva more than 'the devil himself'. Another inexpiable fault is the inability of certain characters with supposedly strong resolve to accomplish what they claim is their greatest goal. If you have a problem with individuals pointing guns at people whom they claim to want dead, letting at least 30 seconds go by, and ultimately not doing anything, then there are a few scenes you'll almost certainly take umbrage with. There is a point about midway into the show where the only logical ending would effectively end the show. Perhaps for that reason, that conclusion is dodged artlessly and everyone re-enters their respective roles. It's a big story to have to tell, but around 40 episodes in I found myself dreading the time I'd have to spend to get to 74. And while that time is used to develop some characters rather nicely, the story moves at a pace that is gradual to a fault. For a supposed thriller, I only found a handful of moments that brought me anywhere near the edge of my seat, and they were too mild, scarce, and late into the show's run to tip the scale much in either direction. Real intrigue was drowned in minutia and storytelling that read more like a book report than a gripping tale. The oft attributed horror component was non-existent, as far as I could tell. I can't remembering feeling legitimate fear once during the show. There were also some hypothesis and claims offered up, and dealt with in ways that left me wanting legitimate answers. Without spoiling anything, the question of split personalities, Nina's significant one-on-one with Gillen, and Johan's true plan and it's relation to Sievernich were all glossed over or dealt with poorly. Regarding the art, Monster's animation quality is serviceable, when you take it's age into account. That said, the character designs always bugged me a bit. The way Naoki Urasawa draws faces, specifically noses and eyes, differs greatly from my preferred style. I don't believe any element of the art inhibited my enjoyment of the show in a significant way, but nonetheless I did find it to be burdensome. The acting is fine (I watched the dub, for the record). I do feel that there were a few lines here and there that were underperformed, but I think Silverstein (Johan), Strassman (Nina), Seitz (Reichwein), and Platt (Eva) particularly did a fine job. The SFX were of a similar quality, a few questionable foley decisions, but generally solid. The music did it's job, as one would expect, not exceptionally impressive or poor. Ultimately, I found myself wanting to see how everything ended up, but not needing to see the next episode like I would with Death Note, or Black Lagoon, for example. Within the last ten episodes the concept of urgency is introduced, far too late to make much of a difference. Some fantastic characters meet fitting conclusions, there's a level of redemption, and finality peeks it's head around the corner, but the way the ending is handled is tantamount to a cop-out. When a show is so wrapped up in finding answers, it's finale should provide more than Monster's did, especially considering the severity of what's left up in the air. Conceivably, the show could've gone on for another 70 episodes, or been wrapped up neatly. Ambiguity like that in a long-running mystery series seems to defeat the point entirely. For the first 20 episodes or so my overall grade hovered around a 6.3, which dipped to a 5.5 a little over halfway in, then, with the ending, to a 4. I'm glad I watched Monster, if only because doing so eliminated all of the curiosity I had regarding it's purported quality. While Naoki Urasawa's opus had it's well-crafted moments, it's ambition outweighed it's intelligence, an unforgivable sin for a psychological thriller.

124517,18153,Kyoukai no Kanata,"['Slice of Life', 'Supernatural', 'Fantasy']",657517,78,815.0,4.0,"For quite the long time, people have exposed their wishes for Kyoani, notable for their several slice of life series with high quality animation, to do something else other than the slow moe-filled series they're famous for. After years of exploring safe territory, they finally announced the highly antecipated supernatural series Kyoukai no Kanata. And with that, set themselves up for what is probably their biggest failure in the last few years. Whether they failed because the transition from slice of life to dark fantasy was too abrupt for them to handle or because they simply do not care for quality anymore, we can't be sure. We can just say for sure that Kyoukai no Kanata went wrong in every single aspect you can imagine, for simultaneously doing too much and nothing at all. The premise is simple and somewhat cliché: half-human, half-youmu high school boy meets fighter girl who manipulates blood and kills youmu for a living. From this encounter, various events unfold. And that's just how it goes. The plot is all over the place; it constantly jumps around between episodes with moe and plain fanservice at its finest to plot-relevant episodes that actually accomplish nothing at all. It goes from fighting to unappealing drama to unfitting comedy to dancing idols. Yes, you heard me right: dancing idols. You should get a feel about how hard they are trying from that. It's like the show can't decide whether it's light-hearted or dramatic. The ""dark fantasy"" label loses all of its meaning when over half of the screentime is spent on flat jokes and the protagonist dressed in costumes for fanservice purposes. The flow of the plot is ragged and it feels like a lot of scenes are incomplete or were cut out from how things are thrown in out of nowhere. Even when things do start to get half-decent, it means nothing when all of the scenes and episodes before that were messy and unfocused. They just feel like lucky pieces of candy in a colorful box full of rocks. As if that's not enough, there is also an incredibly high number of asspulls happening for the sake of melodrama (the final scene alone is one of the single most gigantic asspulls I've ever seen in any piece of fiction), and roughly one or two out of all the plot-related points are explained. The whole story is weak, sloppy and unsatisfying from beginning to ending. That being said, the cast of characters is very fitting to such plot. There's more of them than the show can handle, and they all feel ultimately forced. Our female lead, Mirai, is a typical bland airhead ditzy moe uguu anime girl who's more defined by her overused catchphrase than by her personality traits. Our protagonist, Akihito, seems to be defined as a whole by his fetish for glasses and nothing more. The main cast closes with the Nase siblings Mitsuki and Hiromi, who are an obvious pretext for shoving incest jokes where they don't belong, but are surprisingly the best characters in the show. Like the plot, they are more like sketches that jump around inside their respective stereotypes than actual finished, fully-written characters. They have every kind of adornment you can ask for - catchphrases, defining quirks, canon hobbies, superpowers, fetishes and whatnot - but lack what matters the most: depth that allows them to break free from their respective archetypes. They abuse of Mirai's ""how unpleasant"" catchprase, Akihito's fetish for glasses and Hiromi's siscon so much that watching them becomes absolutely cringe-worthy at some point. They're so empty that sometimes the dialogue about their motivations needs to be filled with these things when the pseudo-depth inserted by unecessary drama won't cut it. The only one out of the main four who actually feels like a character and not a scribble on the last page of a notebook is Mitsuki, but she alone isn't enough to save the character interactions from being a feast of awkward catchphrase exchanges. The supporting cast isn't much better than the main cast. Some of them instigate conflict for reasons that are never explained, some of them just exist without ever doing anything relevant or even being fun to watch (I'm looking at you, Ai Shindou), some of them are likeable but butchered by terrible writing. The main antagonist is bland and unreasonable. Some of the characters literally just fade away in the very last episode with little to no explanation given. Most of them never go through character development of any sort, and reach the ending of the series without having gone through any changes at all. They are a group of characters with a sparkle of potential that was thrown inside of the water, making them useless - there's really no other way to put it. The animation is decent; it is Kyoani after all. The action scenes looked pretty fluid and the characters had good expressions and movements. Not their best, but definitely not bad. The character designs, although not ugly, are really boring and generic. Not much to say about the sound. The voice acting was fine, so was the music, and the only thing that stood out were the OP and ED themes. The art and sound were overall fair and not really bad. Lastly, is Kyoukai no Kanata enjoyable? In some sort of twisted way, it is. As much as you can't help it but noticing how ridiculous and poorly done the whole thing is, it's most likely that it won't bore you. You may get increasingly frustrated with the amount of wasted potential and lazy writting, but you won't get bored. Kyoani's biggest disappointment might be a good thing to go with if you just want something silly to kill time.

62987,3358,Kure-nai,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Martial Arts']",74770,1425,2022.0,7.0,"Once in a while you come across anime from which you expect pretty much nothing to begin with but you see a couple of episodes and find yourself having the urge to continue watching until the very end. ‘Kurenai’ was one of them for me. The story revolves around Kurenai Shinkurou, a high school student who works as a dispute mediator. He possesses abundant martial arts skills and accepts requests from his employer Juuzawa Benika to resolve trifling conflicts and the like. When he demands for something more challenging, Benika consigns him the job of protecting a seven year old kid, Kuohouin Murasaki who belongs to a highly influential and plutocratic household- the Kuohouin family. Having no clue about the young girl’s background, he accepts the job after a bit of hesitation. How Murasaki responds to the world of the commoners and forms bonds with the people around her while constantly battling against the depressing memories of her mother and life at the Kuohouin household are the main focus of the story. While the plot, in itself, may not sound much unique or intriguing, the way it is carried out is quite good. For a short anime with twelve episodes, it was an enjoyable watch. The premise of the first few episodes is Murasaki learning new things and getting acquainted with the people related to Shinkurou, and how she finds joy in little things which she was devoid of. Every episode was fun to watch and none of them felt boring. Not to forget, there were a few moments which were quite amusing to me. The cast is entertaining to say the least. The characters are so vibrant that you can’t help but like them. The protagonist Shinkurou, the cheeky Murasaki and their neighbours— they are such an interesting bunch. One character I personally didn’t like was Houzuki Yuuno, not only because it is infuriating to see people who try hard to gain attention but also because she didn’t seem to have much of a role except that of following around the protagonist. Well, every harem anime needs one I suppose. On that note, this isn’t exactly a harem. While it will be incorrect to say that harem doesn’t exist, it is more or less a side dish which is good in this case at least. The OST is average. Most of the soundtracks were barely noticeable. The only soundtrack that I like is ‘Wasureenu Omoi’ (look for it in Youtube) which played during a dramatic scene in the last episode if I remember correctly.

221518,2418,Stranger: Mukou Hadan,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Historical', 'Samurai']",217756,488,185.0,8.0,"Sword of the Stranger is not a groundbreaking or innovative dish you would find in a five-star restaurant, but rather an average dish with all your favorite ingredients which you love to savor day after day. This film doesn’t fall into the trap of constantly trying to be what it isn’t, that being a frequent issue with many shows and movies alike. It knows its limits, explores the possibilities within the boundaries, and milks every bit of essence out of it making a simple, yet delightful experience. It is neither groundbreaking nor the pinnacle of story telling, but it was a whole damn lot of fun nonetheless. Our two main characters, the young boy Kotarou and the lone samurai Nanashi whom he hires, are identified by their roles in the story, as well as their own personalities and morals which happen to be different from one another. It is because of these differences that they don’t get along at first, but they eventually grow a bond and accept each other. This is a simple yet engaging tale thanks to the delivery and how it’s handled. Nanashi is a cynical, no-nonsense kind of guy. He mainly acts according to logic as opposed to emotion. This makes him a rather arrogant, and frankly annoying person, which is mainly why he has such a shaky cooperation with Kotaru, who acts mainly on emotion. The only reason Nanashi bothers to help Kotaru is because of the reward he receives at the end. But Kotarou’s dog, Tobimaru, who was poisoned by Chinese soldiers, was healed all thanks to Nanashi’s knowledge and act on logic, as well as Kotarou’s cooperation. Through a series of events and compelling dialogue, Kotarou learns to cooperate better with Nanashi, and the two even grow a valuable friendship. This kind of resolution was immensely satisfying to watch. Nothing feels forced or overdone, it all feels natural and well handled. We also get to know about Nanashi’s past as a samurai, which is where his change of heart through Kotaru comes into play. This leads to his development and growth as a character, coming to realization of his emotions and inner desires later in the story. After a long history of working for numerous military organizations without a care in the world, he learns to act on his own volition and to find who he truly wants to protect as a samurai. This results in a climactic part of the film that is wonderfully and beautifully executed. Great directing, beautiful atmosphere, and overall satisfying conclusion. Unfortunately, the other aspects of the story aren’t quite as engaging. I frequently found myself zoning out whenever a dialogue scene between the Chinese militia popped up. They just aren’t all that compelling when compared the main plot. On top of this, our villain, by the name of Luo-Lang, is a villain you would typically find in a Saturday morning cartoon. He is pretty much exactly what you’d expect to see in a “tough-guy, I-fight-alone, always-looking-for-a-good-fight” kind of villain. He keeps his eye on Nanashi in hopes that he will give him the battle of a lifetime, and betrays his team as a result. While it works and is handled well, practically no unique trait is to be found. Of course one could say that he doesn’t need one, considering the kind of approach this film is making. That is indeed understandable. Though while Luo-Lang is a charming character in his own right, I can’t really help but have asked for more. Supernatural elements are also introduced later in the story. They just kind of come out of nowhere and feel like a cheap way of operating the plot. It feels rather out of place especially considering the strictly historical aura the film had at first intended to capture. Moving on, a major contribution to one’s enjoyment of the film is an audio-visual experience. Not only in production value, but in execution. The film looks gorgeous from a technical standpoint, as expected of Studio Bones, but that’s not where it ends. The artwork mostly consists of dim colors, bringing the Sengoku period to life. Each shot is filled to the brim with atmosphere. The lovely backgrounds, the soothing music reminiscent of historical Japan, the attention to detail, and the clever camerawork will immerse the viewer in nearly every scene, making them feel as if they really have been brought into the Sengoku period, witnessing every event from the length of a hair away. Another thing we'll get into now is what this film is vastly praised for: the sword fights. Once again, they already look spectacular based on technicality and animation fluidity, but what really makes them so special is the thought process put behind them. The choreography is brilliantly done, carrying one shot to the next in such a natural and fluid way that is guaranteed to bring the viewer on the edge of their seat. What’s also worth noting is that the battles are not only limited to the clashing of swords. One scene in particular will have Nanashi evading an attack, and swinging a pot of hot water with his hilt right onto the enemy’s face. A variety of weapons are also used including arrows, throwing knives, a whip, and even Tobimaru’s canine teeth. You can see how the creators took the effort to expand their imagination beyond simple sword clashing, making each battle fresh in its own way. An example of a nice touch in the film is how the beginning of a fight and a man fishing are put in the same shot, coincidently moving 1 on 1 right as the fight starts, for added effect. This kind of clever directing is worthy of praise, and a huge part of what makes Sword of the Stranger such a blast. The soundtrack is also a job well done. Not only are the tracks beautiful on their own, they are executed wonderfully and implemented right where and when they need to be used, ranging from calming and atmospheric, to epic and fast-paced. However, most of these tracks contain a very similar theme used again and again. That can be a little annoying to some, but regardless the work and effort put in is still worthy of admiration. So in conclusion, if you are a viewer looking for something new, original, and groundbreaking, then I honestly think you would be better off looking through the works of Masaaki Yuasa. But if you don’t really care about originality, and just want something standard, with numerous great elements bunched into a nifty little package, then I would not hesitate to recommend you this film. And if you’re a fan of samurai, then this film is most definitely for you, because you’ll find pretty much everything you want. Lovable characters, atmospheric historical setting, brilliant cinematography, fluid animation, and memorable sword battles. While not innovative, and in spite of its shortcomings and flaws, Sword of the Stranger is truly a remarkable experience to behold and remember.

63197,10417,Gyo,['Horror'],41084,2149,9778.0,9.0,"Gyo is a waking nightmare. Some people think it's just plain disgusting, or it doesn't have a decent plot, or it doesn't explain anything in detail, or lack of character developement. Neither do nightmares, and this is why Gyo is so great. It is there and fills your screen with grotesque imagery and your head with a fitting landscape. That is what it does, and does it brilliantly. The atmosphere in Gyo is just right for a nightmare. Everything is a bit off and out of place in this piece of bizarre horror. Bad things first: my biggest complaints are not the characters, as for a nightmare acting a bit too normal despite the massively unfathomable situation is yet again only strangely fitting. The biggest complaint is over-use of CGI, which at few points breaks the illusion this show provides. Suddenly, apparently out of nowhere masses of rotting dead fish start to crawl on the ground with strange mechanical devices. Nobody apparently cares. Sure they make news, but at first everyone just sits by idly and takes pictures. Then people start dying, and from there on Gyo only gets more and more bizarre and increasingly disturbing and terrifying. Just by glimpsing the short story synopsis one might shrug their shoulders and think ""well, it sounds rubbish"" - and that is what it is! It makes no sense at all. It is never explained why it happens. It is not supposed to make sense. Origins of phenomena are shed light on, but how it developed is never revealed. If you can adjust to thinking that you are indeed watching a nightmare instead of dark science fiction survival drama, you will love Gyo for that. In one particular scene something that is extremely out of place but still strangely fitting happens, which only increases the feeling that this indeed is a nightmare visualized. That's why I loved Gyo as a horror fan, as it does what Clive Barker has been trying to do for years and in what H. P. Lovecraft only partially succeeded due limitations of medium. Gives you a nightmare to gaze upon.

146885,19163,Date A Live II,"['Comedy', 'Harem', 'Mecha', 'Romance', 'School', 'Sci-Fi']",349133,269,2237.0,8.0,"Harems, a category of anime that involves one person of a specific gender, being surrounded by three or more members of the opposite gender, in hopes that they become the lover of the one person. While Harems aren't the most favorite out of all of the genres of anime, it doesn't always mean that there aren't some really good ones out there. Date A Live II, an anime in which I can safely say, is one of those few. Story (7.89/10): For those of you who haven't seen the first season, Date A Live is an anime series that revolves around our main protagonist Shidou, our sixteen year old main protagonist, who has the ability to seal these otherworldly beings called spirits, who just so happen to all look like attractive/adorable human females from this world. The main idea of the series, is that our main protagonist must seal these spirits away peacefully by no other means than by making them fall in love with him, and sealing them with a kiss. Now, from an idea standpoint, the story is as cliched and redone as it can get, as a similar series, called ""The World God Only Knows"" has done a similar sort of story focal point already. As far as idea originality, this series gets a six point rating at best. But why does the story get a higher rating you ask? That my dear readers is in the story arcs. What makes this season in particular more interesting is the way the story was written out. Compared to its predecessor, Date A Live II has a lot more focus on its characters rather than general fanservice that other harem anime do. In fact, I personally can't even consider this as a true harem, as only a small fraction out of all of the girls in the series actually like the guy in that way. Each of its two story arcs give growth to the new incoming characters to the series, and to our main protagonist, making them feel a bit more real and less platonic. While the development did feel a bit rushed, it was commendable that the writers actually spent time on making the characters more in-depth and important rather than just one here, done, another, done with its characters. Above all, what separates this story from a good chunk of harems out there, is mystery. THe series actually has a good mystery element that is sadly only really explored later on in the series. There's a lot of interesting questions that need to be answered, and that intrigued me, as the story felt like it was evolving into something greater than it would've been at first glance. Aside from that, there were some downfalls of the series. Number 1 is well, the first episode. The first episode was quite a turnoff, as the actual story was really just a big misunderstanding that felt more like an OVA rather than a part of the main story. It did introduce the first arc somewhat, but overall, felt really unessecary and probably turned off some of its fan base due to how excessively comedic (even by date a live standards) it was. Number two is pacing. Some of the episodes admittedly did feel a bit rushed in what they were trying to achieve, making some stuff to go along in order to advance the plot. Given the small time frame of ten episodes, it was sad to see some details that could've used a little bit more explanation. The ending itself felt a bit rushed. I wish the final episode was sort of drawn out into two episodes because it felt really rushed. It was a part of the series I was really itching to see, and to see the arc I anticipated so much become just a half episode standoff, it was quite disappointing really. All in all, Date A Live II had a pretty decent story. It built on what it had before and made the story a lot more deeper and in depth than its predecessor, which is always a plus. On the other hand, there were some time issues with the series that just made it shine a little less than it could've. Overview + Good story arcs + Great character development + Good mystery element - Disappointing final arc - 10 episodes. (The first season was 12.) Characters (7.77/10): The characters of this series is definitely a high point. For every fan of this show, there is a girl that they love. (Kurumi all the way.) Of course, the series itself is a harem, so the gender ratios are well, a bit off. Itsuka Shidou, our main protagonist of Date A Live who has the ability to seal these creatures called spirits with a kiss. (This guy gets quite a bit of action.) At first glance, one could call him just an average harem lead, a guy who's nice to everyone and doesn't want to hurt anyone's feelings, all the while with several girls after his D. (In this case, two girls.) So what sets him apart from many other harem leads? For one thing, he's not dense. He's actually fully aware of the love that some of the girls in the series give him, which makes the experience of watching not so hair-pulling worthy. (Unlike Infinite Stratos) As the series goes on, you can clearly see him prove his worth in the series as he shows himself to be very proactive in doing his job of protecting and saving spirits. The comical dating sim choice thing that occurs regularly in the first series becomes obsolete due to the fact that he chooses and says his own words, making his character feel all the more better. Yatogami Tohka is the main female lead of this series. While personally, I'm not that big of a fan of Tohka, I was a bit saddened to see her role become more of a supportive one rather than a more proactive one. Throughout the series, Tohka served little more than the role of just being there and coming in at the right time to make stuff happen. It wasn't until the final episode where her role really shined, only to be cut in half due to the small time frame. The series on the other hand became quite focused on the three main spirits featured in this season; the Yamai sisters, and Miku. What I can say is the fact that these three are some of the most animated and thought out characters that I've seen in Date A Live other than the main two characters. The reason being is because their stories are quite thought out and detailed. Their stories made the series better on account of the fact that they grew alongside out main protagonist in terms of character development, turning into three dimensional characters that have more to offer than at first glance. Aside from the more focused characters of the series, we have a whole slew of side characters that range from amount of screentime and importance in the series. What I didn't like was the fact that so many characters in the series that had quite a bit of significance in the first season, had barely any significance in this season. Kotori, who was a prominent character, was put in the backseat, along with Origami and my favorite spirit Kurumi, who had barely any screentime altogether. While it didn't impact the series too much as a whole, I did wish I could see these characters a bit more in this season than what was given. But what I can say was a positive, was the fact that we now have established antagonists in the series. This season gave us some pretty interesting antagonists with motives that weren't quite clear to the characters or us, adding into the ever growing mystery of this show that I like. It was a good addition that could only really make the show grow even more. Overview: + Good character development + Good established antagonists - Important character demoted to supporting role - Lack of screentime for some more important side characters Art and Sound (8.00 and 8.01/10): The art for the series was definitely stepped up. The visuals of the series looked fantastic and glorious, the fight scenes were crisp, fluid and amazing. Every character looked great; there wasn't any sort of screw ups for the look of the characters. While the art did look good, there was one big flaw, and that is, darkness. For a good portion of the series, the show looks like Another. The entirety of the frame in some parts of the show looked completely black and made it really hard to see what was going on. It didn't really feel like a good experience and took away parts of the show overall. And the required section for any ecchi show, fanservice. Date a live, with its cast of for the most part, largely chested females, has a quite significant amount of fanservice. Any time a spirit gets her powers sealed, their astral dress will fade, thus baring everything to our main protagonist. (I told you this guy gets some.) What I noticed is the fact that the fanservice seemed to be downgraded, as in there wasn't as much as there was in the first season. Because they put so much time into the plot, there wasn't as much fanservice as there could've been, and that made the series, at least for me, a more pleasurable experience to watch. Though there was some...unnecessary imagery that was used that I preferred not to have seen. For music, the series came with a set of new OP and ED tracks, to me, far exceeding the original series's tracks. The opening sounded similar to the original OP, but different enough to make me like it even more. While it was a memorable track to me, it didn't stick out as something for a long term favorite. The ending on the other hand was a song in a storytelling sequence. The lyrics were that of a fairytale about a hero saving the princess, making this personally my favorite track of the whole series, as it teased about the final arc of the season, that ended up to be quite disappointing. As for background tracks, the series reused practically all of them, from the quirky ones to the battle tracks, to my ever favorite mystical opera one that added suspense and mystery to the scene. The background tracks are actually quite good and make Date A Live, Date a Live. Overview: + Upgraded visuals + Good new tracks - Unnecessary imagery in some fanservice scenes Personal Enjoyment (9.89/10): I'm not adding personal enjoyment to the overall average score for all categories, as it will skew the results. I won't lie, this series is a favorite of mine. It is my guilty pleasure anime, it was my friday afternoons, it was really the first series I marathoned in an entire night when the first season was finished airing. When I first saw that Date a Live was getting a second season, I was ecstatic, itching for the spring season to come out, as this was my most anticipated series of the season. Coming out of it now, I can say a few things seriously. (I'm coming out of fanboy mode now.) Date A Live is one of the better harems you'll find. It's not the best one, but it's one of the better ones. Date A Live isn't a masterpiece. In fact, it has some negative feedback on some points on which I can agree on. By harem standards, it's a good choice to watch. By anime standards in general, you can find a lot of other things to watch. This season did a lot of things well that made the series shine more than before, but at the same time, it did some things wrong. If you don't mind fanservice or harems and like a decent plot that has mystery, action, and romance elements to it, then this series is for you.

The art was very good, Kobeni is one of the cutest girls in anime, and each character is very well animated, and the settings are done decently. The characters are the strongest point in the art department. The sound was pretty cute. They had little piano parts here and there and funny music.

I can forgive the main character for not knowing anything about the giftia but for a company to not even have a manual for its new employes to read and find out how the giftia function and what is expected of both the human and giftia, on top of all this the company failed to notify the office that the main character will be working with so they did not have a partner for him.

It seems non of the people who buy Giftia know that those things have a 9 year and 4 month running time, if this is another poor choice of the company or just scripted to add more ""emotion"" to the other wise bland show. I do not know which it is but both are just as bad. one good thing it has is its sound and art, the art really matches the little feeling there is and all the feelings you do get are from the sound which matches very nicely.

110441,10218,Berserk: Ougon Jidai-hen I - Haou no Tamago,"['Action', 'Military', 'Adventure', 'Demons', 'Supernatural', 'Fantasy', 'Seinen']",135642,824,830.0,7.0,"If I were to describe this film in one word it would be ""awkward"". Though it's based on a manga that I have thoroughly enjoyed thus far (I'm still rather early on in the story) and animated by an extremely reputable studio, I went away from this film with a profound sense of dissatisfaction. Allow me to explain in more detail: Story: This is the area where the film most shows its potential, as well as how much it failed to live up to it. Berserk: The Golden Age Arc I- The Egg of the King is based on an extremely interesting part of the manga Berserk's story. It details the back story of the main characters of the manga; however, only one of their stories is done any justice by this film. But I'll get back to that in the 'Character' section of this review. The reason I bring it up here, however, is to point out just how much the film fails to help me become invested in its characters and their lives. Without my knowledge of the manga, I very much doubt that I would've been able to maintain enough interest in the film to watch it all in one sitting, despite the gorgeous animation. The first mistake that is made in the plot department is in the storytelling priorities of the first half of the movie. It opens on Guts, a young mercenary, gambling with his life for a bit of extra pay by fighting a large and formidable enemy knight one-on-one. While we do not yet have much of a reason to care about Guts, this is fine, as opening with an action sequence is a well-established way of gaining the audience's attention. After the battle, Guts collects his pay and turns down a chance at wealth and status, which serves as a way to entice the audience to learn more about his character. Following that, Guts is attacked and captured by mercenaries from the enemy's side. Up until this point, the film was fine. Then, it started to make some major mistakes, starting with a brief ""flashback"" of sorts. While Guts is unconscious, the audience is exposed to a brief series of images intended to hint at his backstory. The problem is that it is NEVER followed up on. The audience is left with a vague sense of confusion, rendering the entire sequence pointless. If this was an isolated incident, it would be fine, but it's not not. The entire movie feels incredibly disjointed and badly paced. It seems to refuse to give any time to become attached to its characters aside from Griffith, and the main plot of the film, concerning Griffith's attempts to integrate himself into royal society, feels like an afterthought until the last quarter. It's almost as if two movies have been squeezed into the run-time of one, the first concerning Guts' journey to acceptance by the Band of the Hawk and the second following Griffith's aforementioned attempts at upward mobility Simply put, the movie tries to do too much with too little time, and thus ends up not doing much of anything. Art: In stark contrast to the film's story, the art featured in it is absolutely amazing. Large-scale, tense battles unfold on a lush backdrop that seamlessly blends 2D and 3D animation. The character models are, on the whole, gorgeous. Griffith and Judea in particular display a kind of ethereal beauty that is simply breathtaking, while Zod exudes malice from his every pore. While I am not really a fan of this movie, I really can't argue that it is absolutely marvelous to look at. Sound: The voice acting is overall average, but with a few standouts such as the voice of Griffith. The performances are convincing, but not extremely noteworthy. On the other hand, the sound design is excellent. You really get the feeling of being in a large scale battle during the fight scenes, while the quieter scenes are filled with sounds that make one instantly accustomed to this film's representation of nature (most of the movie takes place out of doors). The music is mostly good, but one particular track's English chanting of the phrase ""and blood and guts"" really took away from some otherwise dramatic scenes. Character: This movie's biggest and most gloating weakness is its lack of good characterization. This completely surprised me given how much I've enjoyed the characters in the manga, but the removal of certain key sections does an extreme disservice to them here. First of all, if the film does anyone right, it's Griffith. Of the three core characters, he is the only one given enough time to really become attached in this film. His motivations are clear, but his trademark moral ambiguity makes it through the adaptation process entirely unscathed. He is magnificent, charming, and above all interesting. The same cannot be said for the portrayals of everyone else in this movie. Due to the almost complete lack of any backstory for Guts and Casca, their motives are unclear and their personalities are primarily relayed through what other characters tell the audience rather than what the characters do themselves. Guts has a better deal than Casca, as we get to know him somewhat, but his sudden transformation from loner outcast to someone who not only cares about his comrades but is largely cared about by them over the three year time skip is just too much to swallow. Needless to say, the non-main characters fair far worse. In fact they aren't really featured enough in the film for me to really call their involvement here as much more than a series of cameos where they serve as people for Guts, Griffith, and Casca to speak with. Enjoyment: While this movie was very exciting at points, I came away feeling very unsatisfied. There was just too much material for a seventy-some minute film to cover. It would have been much better if the movie finished after the fight with Zod, and took the time to adapt Guts' early adventures with the Band of the Hawk rather than skipping straight to Griffith's bid for the throne. Overall: If I can say one thing about this movie, it's that it made me want to read the manga. While that isn't a bad thing, the aim of a movie should be to be involving in and of itself rather than pushing its audience to experience the source material if they want a fulfilling story.

Despite the smooth animation, crisp visual style and well written comfy soundtrack, this movie is a drag to watch. The story is unfortunately basic. Two friends are playing important parts in a concert band piece and relate themselves to the story behind the piece. They have a very gay scene at the end where they hug and say what they love about each other. In the end, they become closer friends because they understand each other more. There is not enough content to stretch the movie out to 90 minutes with. The first scene is seven and a half minutes and literally nothing happens. The movie takes place in two locations. The first is the school, which consists of a couple generic highschool rooms. The second is the world of the music piece, which uses a different art style to differentiate it from the real world. When the movie is in the real world, the style looks like that of A Silent Voice. When it's in the music piece, it looks somewhat like a picture book and uses the style of Baja's Studio. The soundtrack is the most important part of the movie. The titular piece, Liz and the Blue Bird, was made specifically for the movie. We don't hear much of it, just the 3rd movement. The piece was made to reflect the contrasting personalities of the two main characters. The rest of the soundtrack is relaxing and subdued pieces that are intended to evoke a dreamlike feeling, and succeed in doing so. The story was not one worth telling. While it's an improvement upon Hibike Euphonium Season 2's arc revolving around the two leads, spending 90 minutes watching two girls walk around some halls, talk to each other and play instruments is not engaging. The visuals of A Silent Voice were more consistent and more impressive due to the many different locations and plot events that allowed for lots of animation. The style of Baja's studio is too cutesy and childish, but it isn't used enough to be a large problem. The soundtrack is the major reason to watch the movie. It wouldn't have as much significance if you listened to it by itself since it needs the context of the movie. Even so, Liz and the Blue Bird is too boring to be worth your time.

305185,35313,Kemono Friends 2,"['Adventure', 'Comedy']",11248,4143,8529.0,5.0,"Kemono Friends didn't die....it was murde- it turned into a franchise zombie. Kemono Friends was a juggernaut sleeper hit in Japan mostly done by Tatsuki, however with some executive meddling from Kadokawa, Tatsuki was unfairly fired and Kemono Friends went on with a seocnd season without Tatsuki, the visionary and lifeblood of the series itself gone. The second season to say that it felt underwhelming was an understatement but not to the point of botchery, just half assed. So Kemono Friends 2 starts off with a new character who doesn't know where she is and wants to find her home with a sketchbook, she finds many various Friends along the way and find out more about Japari Park and the Ceruleans and Beasts that they happen to find. On the basis the new character Kyururu voiced by Yui Ishikawa is an even watered down Kaban from the first season but she is also accompanied by Serval from the first season and Caracal voiced by Riko Koike who's keeps Serval in check. Now the first season's mysteries made the anime and the audience question Japari Park and it's guests and to be more precise humans and what happened to them, why Ceruleans roam and how they even exist in the first place, it was subtle in it's mystery and utilized well with it's first season to portray something deeper than it was initially, The second season on the other hand has some lackluster and blatant mysteries thrown in without a hint of subtlety and it seemed that the second season cared more about it's slice of life comedy aspect than the mystery which was the buildup of the first season, the second season doesn't have ANY of that and yes there are small mysteries in this second season but they give out such blatant hints and questions answered as quickly the next episode that the mystery is barely there let alone what it was in the first season. YES Kemono Friends IS a slice of life comedy, but it was also a mystery, a GOOD mystery hidden away and dive bombed when it hit it's climax about the revelations, the second season just got the barebones of it, used it's nostalgic callbacks and points of interest and rarely delved into what it was trying to do and when it did, it ""tried"" but without the hint of solidarity to itself, it felt scattershot as if it was trying to tick off a checklist. Now as much as LA is harping on the second season and it's major flaws, the second season still has some merit to it as the second season DOES in some form like it's world building and developing it's new and old characters (no not just Serval) and what mysteries are given to us, the biggest and ONLY one being a Beast following Kyururu and co. is the ONLY point of interest as it's never told outright what and HOW Beasts were created. The animation emulates Yaoyorozu to an ok degree as it's now done by Tomason though some of the character designs did felt a bit nonchalantly done, the animation was just ""ok"", but felt like a downgrade weirdly enough, Yaoyorozu had a small budget and they managed to pull it off, Tomason's animation just looked like it was aping from Yaoyorozu's low animation as an excuse to keep it low quality jank (maybe as a form of consistency towards the first season, but come on), but what Tomason did...it wasn't horrible, as LA said, it's to keep with the consistency towards Yaoyorozu and to that LA wouldn't outright say the animation was the biggest flaw, ohhh no, the plot was the main culprit for that one. The voice cast is decent enough though LA didn't expect Kyururu to be voiced by Yui Ishikawa of all voice actors, not saying she's horrible for the role, just that LA didn't expect her to. LA will be here all day if LA pointed out all voice actors, so the only notable ones are Yuka Ozaki reprising her role as Serval and she did well considering the material given anyways. Either way, decent voice cast. Kemono Friends 2 for LA kinda lost itself with Tatsuki gone, but through watching the anime, it tried, especially with the director Ryuuchi Kimura trying to show a different side of Kemono Friends, that of the slice of life aspect of it and good on him for trying to show it in his own way let alone all the backlash that he really doesn't deserve (that belongs towards Kadokawa), but Kemono Friends was just ALOT more than that and it doesn't show here unfortunately. People might not have never wanted to see another Kemono Friends after the debacle with Kadokawa and Tatsuki and to the people who do, you STILL have the first season and for the people who sees Kemono Friends 2 as something new and different, that's fine to. But the one lingering thought that Kemono Friends 2 kept giving LA constantly was if the first season was ANY good to begin with and this sequel definitely gave off that vibe time and again, now LA isn't saying this sequel dirtied the franchise but ""worrying"" to say the least. Ultimately for all the sides that either hate or praise this second season, LA is more or less on the side of the former, but not to the degree of hate you'd expect as LA did see some potential from all this, but it just didn't have the true spirit of Kemono Friends to keep LA interested like it did the first season and felt more aimless, lackluster and clamoring onto it's nostalgia of the first season more than anything but the second season being sullened?...no...scattershot...yes.

Hayao Miyazaki's groundbreaking anime phenomenon stills holds up as my favorite animated film in the world right now, cause come on? It's Hayao Miyazaki and he knows how to create engaging worlds. It's such an imaginative and engaging story, that James Cameron's describes both Spirited Away and Osamu Tezuka's Metropolis, both films that are full of ""Beauty, Power, Mystery and above all, Heart"". Spirited Away is about Chihiro Ogino, a 10 year old girl who move into a new town with her parents, only to discover that they get lost and later, they found an abandoned amusement park and Chihiro's dad insists them to explore the park. However, a boy name Haku warns Chihiro that this park is forbidden and that she must leave the place before nightfall. Chihiro finds her parents, only to find them transformed into pigs and the entire park gets full of black spirits on nightfall. Now Chihiro works for a creepy old lady, Yubaba, as a servant, changes her name from Chihiro to Sen and if she forgets her real name, she would be trapped in the spirit world forever, Now Chihiro must find a way to save her parents and escape the spirit world, as she learns to accept her life through adulthood on her own. The story is just fantastic and really engaging, as we see a young girl trying to face the toughest situations on her own and believing in herself on what she can do to help the people she loves. Also, there are a lot of touching moments in Spirited Away, my favorite has to be the one where Chihiro sits with a black spirit ""No Face"" in the train station, as the music plays peacefully in the background. Spirited Away looks STUNNIG!!!!! The animation made by Studio Ghibli is still the best looking anime, out of all the Miyazaki movies out there (except Mononoke, that's impossible to top). The Japanese culture style of the film really fits into this strange spiritual fantasy film, full of strange but fascinating creatures, spirits and those cute black furballs that appear are also strange but cute. Character designs are very fluid and they really act like actual human beings, like it really brings strong emotions to the character's as they progress through the story on saving Chihiro's parents. Voice acting is fantastic, but the dubbing is perfect, thanks to the wonderful support of Pixar and John Lasseter. Lasseter and Pixar have great respect to the anime industry and to Hayao Miyazaki, cause John loves the works of Studio Ghibli and never make dumb changes to the film so that it's stays true to the work of the director and the English cast that John assembled is fantastic. All the actors voicing the characers were great, including Daveigh Chase, Tara Strong, Jason Mardsen, Suzanne Pleshette, David Ognen Steirs and so on. Spirited Away is just a groundbreaking masterpiece by Hayao Miyazaki. If I were you, I would see it again, rather than describing how spectacular the film is and why anime has the balls to bring true originality than most of the garbage Hollywood brings nowadays. Spirited Away is a must-own film for any anime fan out there wanting to experience this great film on their TV's.

296705,37989,Golden Kamuy 2nd Season,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Historical', 'Seinen']",64691,1587,369.0,8.0,"I should have probably ate something before reviewing Golden Kamuy. Even thinking about this show makes me hungry and it’s not what I had in mind. But hey, seeing this golden egg return again for a sequel is such a welcome delight. Remember, this sequel continues from the first season and now indulges on the continued quest of Sugimoto and his ever daring adventures. It makes a memorable return with the first episode introducing Edogai Yasaku, a taxidermist. Right off from this season, he shows his true colors with his expertise related to human skin. While not being an actual killer or sadistic as Tsurumi, I dare say that he’s not someone to be underestimated. An early alliance also sparks between him and Tsurumi. Speaking of which, do you remember Tsurumi? Serving as the lieutenant of the 7th division, Tsurumi is one of the key antagonists in this show. Many words can be used to describe him such as erratic and unstable. In the second season, he shows his ruthless behavior again although at the same time, I find his sarcastic tone and unpredictable personality to be most welcoming. It adds surprising elements that makes the plot much more fluid. But of course, who can forget about our Saichi Sugimoto and his companion, Asirpa. The pair became inseparable and their adventures continue with even more stakes on the line. Joining them is also Yoshitake Shirashi, the goofball butt monkey. While many see him as a comic relief with his carefree attitude, he does play valuable roles in this season. It’s easy to sugarcoat him as the middleman between the two main characters as well. However, I believe the second season is both plot and character driven. Early in this season, Suigimoto’s group deals with Edogai but we also shouldn’t forget about the man known as Hijikata. His past with Shinpachi is important to recognize due to their similarities during their younger years. In addition, we also take a deeper dive into his past when he was once a prisoner at Kaboto. And I think it’s one of the many things that makes this show stand out. It makes the audience care about characters like Hijikata. Even though he isn’t a prominent figurehead like Sugimoto, his past made him evolve as a person to where he is today. I should probably warn you though. This show is not light on violence, whether physically or mentally. But by showcasing its content in such way, it makes this anime that more realistic. Speaking of the plot, Shirashi gets caught that puts his life into jeopardy. While the audience may dismiss his capture as lesser importance, we should remember that he is in the hands of the 7th division. That’s the same group known for their sadistic tendencies thanks to their charismatic lieutenant, Tsurumi. The plot also brings in new characters like Kiyohiro Suzukawa, a deceptive man who is able to slip into the ranks of enemies. I should probably also mention that while Kiyohiro is more or less a con artist, his role brings in suspense to the plot. It makes me want to see them succeed in recusing Shirashi regardless what dangers await them. Eventually, the plot turns into a cat and mouse game. We get to see the main conflict escalate into fights for survival. Thankfully, Sugimoto still retains his military skills and we see them in action against the 7th division. On the other hand, the show also explores the character connection between Tanigaki and Kenkichi. I’ve mentioned before but this sequel is also very character driven that explores the past relationships between important characters. Kenkichi may seem like a minor character at first but the show reinforces the idea of how human lives can be so fragile. The second season establishes an important concept about how broken their world is and what characters can do to change it. Now while I can say this season can get deep and emotional, there’s also a decent amount of lighthearted moments. If you remember from the first season, food is a part of the show that eclipses more than just a gimmick. That’s because food is essentially for survival and we get no shortage of those from this season. Asirpa brings in her knowledge of the Ainu culture with her as well those survival skills. We even get woodcock hunting as a showcase of one of her many talents. I should say that Aspira is a breakout character. She and Sugimoto has been through a lot together and despite some of their personality differences, they work together well as a pair. My impression of Aspira this season is no less different than the first season as she continues to educate viewers about Ainu culture. In later episodes, her eyes also play important role in a case that adds suspense to the story. But don’t let that fool you from the show’s motives. It has a great amount of balanced content between the light and dark. In other words, this season has an emotional and serious story but always has time to find moments to make fun of itself. If you don’t believe me, just check to see how much man service this season really became. Thanks to what it has established, I say without a shadow of a doubt that Golden Kamuy Season 2 is more than just watchable. It’s a show that manages to capitalize on its variety of genres and bring in a exhilarating story. It has a larger-than-life character cast with important purposes. With each passing episode, I felt more compelled to watch more. And so should you.

And since it centers around the competition of the sports, I would expect the graphic to be at least intriguing to watch and yes, I could say it did -flow is more relaxing Because the story is not too serious and tense, we wouldn't need to be too focused on the story since it flows quite relaxing, hence making it more enjoyable so plus point to this -fun Well, okay I could say that aokana focuses more on fun, so... yeah -characters are clear The character development is acceptable, it doesn't have too many characters that would make us really confused and it focuses more on the main characters, but it does lack a bit of the characters backstory. And the cons -the competitions are a bit boring Despite from being something fresh, the competition doesn't really have much variation, thus making it a bit boring for me. Of course this is to be expected as it not a common sport, but I thought it could have a bit more variation The most intriguing one I found is only at episode 12 and yeah, the last episode -Story development aokana is weak at the phase of the story. Every phase of sports is crucial, by this I mean that from the introduction of the sports, the practice, the competition, until the win or loss, everything. The introduction of the sports didn't have any problems. What I felt missing is from the practice until the result of the competition. It didn't pack a punch -an imbalanced character This imo is one of the most weakest point in aokana and the biggest factor to why I rate low As everybody knows, Asuka is the character that has the most spotlight, in fact, aokana prioritize her too much. And to add it, Asuka is too OP, it felt like the most important thing is talent, not hardwork. She could easily do anything, I mean anything any other people could do. This kind of talent itself is not that bad of a plot, but for it to be over exploited leaves a bad outcome. To conclude, aokana does have many flaws, but is still enjoyable to watch It is more of a leisure anime than a serious one and is better to watch if you are just intrigued and isn't really expecting much I really wished it to give more spotlight to Masaya though, and in a certain episode (no spoilers intended) did gave my hopes up, but....

At first, what attracted me was the cover, and made me think ""wow it seems the story is interesting"" When I realized it was Donghua and like having a smooth animation, it reminded me of how smooth the Quanzhi Gaoshou's animation (The King's Avatar) was and I was interested in reading the synopsis. And hey, even the animation is really more pretty and spoils my eyes well. And finally, I have no regrets about watching it. What I regret is because I didn't watch it earlier -,- And because im waiting for the Season 2, i starting to read the Manhua and Novel to satisfy my curiousity. It looks like i can't stop to curious eventhough the Season 1 Donghua already ended. SPOILER ALERT!!!! . . . . . . . . . . . Story : 9/10 Actually I really enjoy the storyline, but for this season of Donghua, it's more shown about our MC's past lives, Wei Wuxian, when he started to know Lan Wangji and every problem he faced began at the GusuLan sect (even though he was there to study) , how was his free and visible adolescence, how he found new friends, made problems even in his own sect (Yunmeng Jiang) that made his childhood friend, Jiang Cheng, have to lose his parents (where Jiang Chen's father was a friend of Wuxian's father and adopted Wuxian because of that, and also because he once loved Wuxian's mother), how he tried to save Jiang Cheng, how he tried to avenge the Qishan Wen sect about what happened, and especially about how he gained new power to control the corpse life. Wei Wuxian was arguably one of the skilled cultivators even before the SunShot Campaign problem, and since he gain new power that more powerful and already wipe out Qishan Wen sect who attacked the rebel headquarter, he had returned to Yunmeng Jiang sect with Jiang Cheng to rebuild the sect after the Qishan Wen sect had been destroyed In this season, as told how the origin of all the events that occurred so that the flow of flashback is indeed dominating. The scene in episode 2 when Wangji realized that it was Wei Wuxian who was reborn in Mo Xianyu's body, also quite made me nervous and loved it! It is quite difficult here to remember about events in this universe, because the storyline is indeed quite complicated to just follow lightly, and some place names, or year names, or time names and so on that might not be familiar because thats in Chinese culture, and some scene of the time skips made me confused sometimes, but overall is very pleasant to watch Sound: 9/10 The first time I listened to the opening song, it was very smooth and pleasant to hear, really ear catching~~ The notes are soft but not flat. Some of the beat-ups that make the opening feel emotional, plus song lyrics like telling what happened in the story. Similar things almost happened to the ending song, even though I preferred the opening song and never got tired of hearing it even in each episode Each music background in the scene, is also appropriate and supports what happened, making the scene feel more alive and thrilling to watch. Character: 10/10 Each characters are really lovable, and ehm, handsome. Some characters look very similar if there is nothing that distinguishes them like the forehead ribbon or the color of the shirt But I'm good at being able to distinguish them quickly because each character is like having his own characteristics. Art : 9/10 For Chinese animation, Mo Dao Zhu Shi was very successful. Every animation of the character really spoils my eyes, they have muscular body, have a good height or once small, looks cute. Smooth hairs and very piercing eyes are pretty beautiful How they describe the setting of each scene also looks detailed and interesting. Seems like they're seriously to working in this Donghua Even the animation for the opening song is packed well in my opinion. Enjoyment: 10/10 THIS IS BL STORY (even though that only applies to the MC), so if you dont like kind of this, just watch something else ,, But really, this's something really worth to watch. Forget about shounen ai things first,thats not something you have to worried too much about, the whole story is very interesting How is the struggle, happiness, fall, problems, and so on executed well in this donghua. Aalthough there are some parts that look like a plot hole, believe me, that is because this season is focused on flashback as the beginning of the story going forward for next season.

205243,21185,Baby Steps,"['Romance', 'School', 'Shounen', 'Sports']",102172,1083,690.0,8.0,"So this is my third sports anime that I've watched (The others are Kuroko no Basket and Haikyuu) and I am starting to fall in love with Sports anime. Usually, the genre of anime I usually watch are action and romance, but then I always give other genres a chance, maybe to relate with a lot more anime fans. It starts of with a boy named Eiichiro Maruo, a smart and diligent student who doesn't really enjoy life. I mean, yes, he is a happy person, but he doesn't really have a hobby. I don't think writing notes is considered his hobby. It's just from his personality. One day, he wanted to exercise and wanted to try out a sport. That sport was (Obviously) tennis. Baby Steps is one of those sports anime series done right... In terms of build up from a weak character gradually developing into one of the best tennis players in the world. From other sports anime I've watched, they mostly start of with a character that already has a skill that he is good at, but the problem is the usage of that skill so he has to improve. This anime is different and much more realistic. What I truly like from this anime is how simple it is. It doesn't try to complicate itself. Sports anime like this are easily enjoyable. Not just that, this is probably one of the most well-paced sports anime I've ever seen. So there's not a moment where you'll feel bored (When it's slow-paced) and even if they skipped some parts in a tennis battle or skipping some tennis practice, I feel like they did the right decision to do so. They only show some parts where the thrill is at and/or where it's enjoyable to watch which I really like. I know that MAL also classify this show as ""Romance,"" but it's not heavily on romance. This show focuses heavily on sports, but there are indeed some romantic parts. Just don't expect a lot of its romance. 8/10 for the story is a very good score, so if that isn't ""very good"" to you, translate it to a score that you consider it as ""very good."" I didn't increase the score to 9 or 10 because it didn't conclude the series and this isn't really new. I just appreciate how well-paced this anime is. The animation is good. Not bad. This anime doesn't really show smooth moments unlike other sports anime I've seen. It's usually rough. This anime also suffer from still frames, but they use this to visualize where the ball went, so it doesn't really bother me. What bothers me the most has to be it's art style. Eiichiro Maruo is good looking, but his rooster-hair bothers me the most... at first. I got used to it after watching more episodes of this anime. Most of it's female characters are really drawn well, but for the male characters especially the ones who are just supporting, the art style is weird. It has to be on how the nose is drawn. Most of their noses look like Squidward from Spongebob Squarepants and there are some noses where it's wide. For the soundtrack, most of it's OST just makes you get pumped up, but I don't think it's as thrilling as some OST I hear from other sports anime. It's hard to explain (I do admit that I suck at explaining OSTs). It's just that I feel like it's ""lacking."" For the opening theme and ending theme, I love it. They're catchy and it really makes you pump up for this show. For the characters, they're enjoyable. The character development is really done right. You will see Maruo on how he develops with his friends and family and almost all of them aren't useless to him. I do admit that the characterization isn't perfect. Some of them end up being cliche like Takuma being one of your typical badass. Still, what really matters is how they change the story of Maruo and that's what made this show good. Overall, if you hate sports anime that rigs matches (In terms of pacing and how long the match is) or hate sports anime that are unrealistic, stop right there and try watching this anime. This sports anime doesn't really bring nothing new to the table for some, but this is new to me because this is only my third sports anime. If you love tennis (Or played some tennis before), I HIGHLY recommend this show.

The focus isn't mainly on action, though it does have some visually stunning action scenes. Alot of the time, it will just be conversations between characters, but this is the blood that keeps this series alive and flourishing. Without it, you'd have a normal show with above average production. This type of show isn't for everyone, but I personally love it. [ART: 10/10] The animators went all out animating this show, as detail and flamboyance embody the artistic direction of this show. Each character's design and set piece is carefully planned out, and it shows. [SOUND: 10/10] The voice actors become their characters when they act them out, that's how into them they get. They really care about their role, you can tell. And sound effects are well done as well, nothing seems off in that department. [CHARACTER: 10/10] Most every character is important to the main plot of the story and if they aren't a main character, the style of the show makes it seem as if they don't even exist.

I never thought my next review would be on one of the most hyped-up shounens of 2017. For months everyone I knew that watched anime were telling me to watch this saying, ""It's the greatest anime of the year; all other shows this year are trash compared to this; you must watch this, this is one of the most refined shounen anime ever made...etc."" It makes sense that this is extremely hyped considering that many people really like shounen anime, but now, it's time for me to give my opinion and explain why this score is my most controversial score of 2017. Before I begin, I'll say that I actually gave the 1st season of Boku no Hero Academia a 7/10. To summarize my opinion on that; it's a good, well-refined shounen, but there wasn't anything spectacular about that show. When I heard about how good Season 2 was, I had some high hopes. Now that that's out of the way...the actual review Story: 7 U.A. Sports Festival Arc (Tournament Arc): 6 This looks extremely bizarre that I'm giving a tournament arc. I didn't expect to give this arc the score that I gave it. Once I heard about the tournament arc, I was excited. After watching it, I was in shock about how extremely disappointing this arc actually was. Until the actual tournament part, the obstacle race and chariots were this arc's preliminary rounds and it was actually interesting to see prelims that aren't actually like the tournament itself. Nothing much to say there; it was good stuff. My problems come during the actual tournament portion. The actual first match was incredibly interesting due to Deku attempting to deal with brainwashing, but due to his opponent's quirk being brainwashing and lacking the physical capabilities of kicking someone's ass in CQC, needless to say, it was short-lived but unusually satisfying. After that, most of the other fights were completely one-sided ring-outs with the losing person not putting up much of a fight with a few exceptions, but even those exceptions, it still left me extremely disappointed. Out of the 15 (or 13 to be precise) fights that happened, only 5 of them actually stood out. I mentioned the first one before and the other ones are Todoroki v. Deku, Tokoyami v. Bakugo, Uraraka v. Bakugo, and Todoroki v. Bakugo. Even though these fights stood out, at least to me, these aren't actually fights even though they had to either cause a ring-out or cause the opponent to give up, which is pretty much the standard for almost every single tournament arc that has existed since the mid 80s, which is my main issue; they completely mess up a shounen trope that went perfectly well in Season 1. Ok, in Season 1, they had to go through an exercise where the ""heroes"" had to either disarm the bomb, or capture the ""villains"". That was supposed to be an exercise and that one exercise had better fights than this tournament arc which is completely ass-backwards. I understand why this tournament arc existed in the first place and I understand why some characters acted the way they did during their fights; this was supposed to give backstory, personality and motivations for characters like Todoroki, Tokoyami and a few others, as well as serving as the platform for the next story arc (which is a tournament arc standard). All that character stuff is really good, but if the fights themselves are sub-par and leaves a lot to be desired, I'd rather go watch something else that can execute them much better...like Boku no Hero Academia S1. Internship/Finals Arc? (WTF do I call this arc?): 8 This might also appear controversial, but I feel that the storytelling and overall narrative was much better mainly because this is not a tournament arc and explores what some of the other students feel about what makes a hero. That's the short and sweet version, but I'm gonna go further. After the tournament, the students applied for internships, and from there, they train, become stronger, learn how reality works, a hero's role in current society, and what exactly makes a hero. Not all of the characters are explored, but a considerable amount were given screen time, and it was all directed towards those characters that didn't get any time during the tournament as well as the main characters. With this arc, we're introduced to the Hero Killer: Stain (who honestly appears out of left field.). Even though he came out of nowhere, he had his ideals of what the main difference is between a ""true hero"" v. a ""fake hero"". Although he's killed many heroes as he traveled, he is actually correct when it came to the heroes within the current society, which is one of the reasons why I wished he lasted longer within this arc. Once he's gone, his ideals are spread all over the internet and villains are answering his call for action. Shigaraki goes from a supremely generic villain that only wants to kill All Might because evil, to a person that's willing to adopt ideals he rejects with his soul in order to accomplish as well as actually doing something in threatening Deku at the mall which makes me more interested in this character. Overall the story and narrative was well executed, but some of the fights in the tournament arc left a lot to be desired, but the 2nd half of this season somewhat made up for it despite some minor pacing issued and some characters with brilliant ideals coming from the remnants of the dump. Art/Animation/Fights: 8 The art is really stylized for this specific series which works so well, and the animation that accompanies it does it absolute justice. There's not much to say about this since everyone knows about this animation and how good it is. I already mentioned how sub-par the fights. However, the choreography in some of those fights are good with the highlights being Todoroki/Deku/Iida v. Stain, Deku/Bakugo v. All Might, and Deku v. Todoroki. Most of the other fights are...'aight...I guess..............moving on Sound: 7 Amazing OST and voice acting from the cast. Wasn't the most amazing OST but it works within the context of Boku no Hero. I will say that OP 2 of this season is better than OP 1. Fight me! Character: 8 The character development and growth that was present, especially during the tournament arc and the 1st half of the internships up until the fight with Stain, was really good. There's also not much to say here since everybody and their mothers know about most of the characters, so saying those things here would be redundant. The show speaks for itself. Enjoyment: 7 Enjoyment was a bit skewed here, mainly because of the tournament arc. S1 proved that there can be really good fights between students, something that this season completely fucked up. They did well with the limitations that were in place for some of the students like Deku, but it should've been more...intense. It's because of that my enjoyment of this tournament was a 5/10. The character stuff was really good and necessary, but the sub-par fighting makes it almost seem like the stuff on the screen was just there. For the 2nd half, enjoyment was a 9/10. Not only were the ideals of Stain interesting, but much of the supporting cast got more screen-time along with the main cast. Watching all of them wonder what makes a hero in their current along what's real and what's fake was really cool to watch. Overall: 7 This season was a step up from S1, but it was mainly that tournament arc that brought it down for me due to the extremely lack-luster fight scenes. The 2nd half of this season made up for it, but lacked in certain areas that prevent me from giving this show a higher score (like that actually matters). Looking forward to Season 3!

It was one of my first too. Many people these days who are new to anime wouldnt like the ""old art style"" or ""Stupid romance"". Some even say that the title enough is dumb. InuYasha is a masterpiece, as well as a classic. If you never heard of this anime before, please read this review to learn more about it. I will try not to include to much spoilers. The storyline starts off well. In fedural Japan, a demon boy with dog ears and long white hair with gold eyes named InuYasha comes to a village in search for a jewel called the Shikon no Tama. Once he got the jewel, he is pinned to a tree by a girl named Kikyo. He falls into a slumber for 50 years. Kikyo then dies. 500 years later a girl named Kagome is pulled down a well by a demon. She then comes into Fedural Japan, where she mets InuYasha on the tree. Soon after, a demon apppears looking for the Shikon no Tama. It turns out that Kagome is the reincarnation of Kikyo. InuYasha awakens and kills the demon with his claws. He then tries to steal the Shikon jewel. But then the jewel breaks apart.(Im not going to spoil this). InuYasha and Kagome have to team up in order to find all the pieces. They are joined by other characters that apppear later, Shippo, Sango. and Miroku. The story line is very easy to get hooked on to. It is very enjoyable. There are plenty of fight scenes and blood. Characters do die as well. There are swords, claws, arrows. There is romance, but its great. The romance made some of the best anime couples in anime history. Of course there is romantic comedy too. While the art may be out dated, it is still charming. The character design is still good, and the old art still looks great. The art gets better at around episode 99. Its still great. The character devleoplment is amazing. Characters like Sesshomaru seem like total badasses and thats it. But as the story goes on, characters like him, change over time and become ""good guys"". Other characters like InuYasha seem like evil characters at first, but soon he changes a lot after making friends. Evens some villians like Kagura change. In the end, all the characters matured, and changed. Th series still has great music. It has one of the best OSTs out. All of the opening and ending themes are great, the best are Grip!, Dearest, and Every Heart. The sad, upsetting songs are beautiful. A lot of the music sounds epic as well. Like the fight music. This is a anime that can be sad to. The ending as sad yet beautiful. Moments like in the Band of Seven arc has a very sad scene that made me almost cry. In the Final Act, there are a few moments that will make you cry like a bitch. So be prepared, this anime can be very sad at times. Every time I watch this anime, there is always that moment that hits me in the feels. When you watch it you will understand. For overall enjoyment, iv'e enjoyed this series a lot. It is charming, lovable, and still is great to this day. No anime I have watched yet is more enjoyable than InuYasha. Its a fantastic show. I have seen this anime like a million times, and im still lovin it. I still cry at the right moments, laugh at the right moments, and get hyped at the right moments. This is one of the greatest animes of all time. Try it out. You will like it.

22362,2963,Minami-ke,"['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'School']",138209,802,1079.0,9.0,"Review from Zagrom, Otaku-Unlimited.net This is a slice of life, comedy series based around the life of three sisters. Minami Haruka, the eldest sister, the sweet and motherly sister. She is also the most reliable of the three sisters but is lazy when left alone. Although the oldest she is still a second year of high school. And in junior high through several misunderstandings obtained the nickname Banchō (or badass, used to refer to a leader of delinquents, etc, etc) Minami Kana (my favorite) the family retard, or baka if I may. The middle sister, second year junior high. The type of girl that nearly always acts before thinking, does poorly in school (she misreads kanji a lot) she tends to find excuses to make things more interesting. Minami Chiaki, they youngest sister in elementary (I estimate 5th year, perhaps sixth?) She is made out to be highly intelligent by her friends but it seems that she thinks of things in a rather simple way. She things VERY highly of Haruka and is very formal with her, but uses the term bakayarō (a more strict form of baka) with Kana often. Episodes: 13 Story: 9/10 I cant really explain much being a slice of life series, there is no real plot. There are plenty of ""love triangles"" but I use that term losely as really there is no proper shape to give it, the love goes all over the place and really does keep things about as funny as it gets. All in all the story all fits together, is easy to get, and is overall funny, A+ Characters: 10/10 Great job on this, alto only 13 episodes you seem to get plenty of time to see almost all the characters grow and change in the series and really get to get a hold of there personality's, and all of them have there on style and stories, no copy paste at all. Music: 9/10 Liked all the back ground music, and OP and ED, not mush else to say, I watched every OP (normally just do it on first and last episode) Love that OP song ^^ Art: 9/10 Art was clean and interesting, there were really two styles, which is sort of hard to explain unless you watch it, there is the main style (like the image above) and a more serious one that comes up from time to time, mostly between the three Minami sisters when they become more serious between one another, whicch I found weird the first few times but it became normal and then sorta grew on me. Overall: 9/10 Has become me second favorite series behind Lucky Star with ease, that should say enough (for me anyway). Highly recommended and one with a high rewatching value in my opinion, also note it has a second season Minami-ke Okawari (Note that this was my first MAL review, hope you enjoyed) Helpful",2636,Positive,Positive,"Slice-of-life comedy about three sisters, praised for engaging story and characters.","{""sentiment"":""Positive"",""summary"":""Slice-of-life comedy about three sisters, praised for engaging story and characters.""}"

And even in that department it has flaws (the characters are way too traditionally drawn). The story is, actually, non-existent, and we get to see only a glimpse of character development. There's a wide range of quasi-philosophical mumbo-jumbo which seems absolutely random and pointless. This movie did nothing for me. I've seen more happening in first five minutes of a series that has 110 episodes, than I've seen in 50 minutes of Kara no Kyoukai: Fukan Fuukei. The sound has it's good moments. But there's so much silence, trying to unsuccsessfully create an 'atmosphere' that the movie, in my opinion, fails in this department too. The good parts (art, sparse fight scenes) are slaughtered by Aozaki Touko's lamentations, as well with trying to force a dark, desperate atmosphere onto the beautifully drawn world. I guess it was supposed to be smart and intellectually enticing, posing questions about suicide, courage to withstand life, and whatnot. However it may try, the movie fails. The characters seem as rough drafts, with too many typical traits, the stoyline of a 50 minute movie should have actually existed. Now, I do not know the background of the story. I have not read the novels, I just wanted to watch a movie for a change. I think Kara no Kyoukai should have been categorized as a series. Because Fuukan Fuukei cannot call itself a movie, even if it goes on for 50 minutes. I will watch the other 6 movies because I hate making decisive opinions about something I haven't gotten to familiarize myself with completely. However, I think it is reasonable to form an opinion after watching something that calls itself a movie.

Outstanding animation, fortuitously proficient in visual quality as if every episode was a movie. A fitting and adaptive story and much more. Story : 10/10 The story was marvelous. It mostly focuses on the main character of the anime, ""Violet Evergarden"". Although some scenes within the anime may be slightly timid due to the anime trying to adapt from the LN. The story is complex and it requires a fair amount of deep understanding. Art : 10/10 I am speechless, I have nothing to say about the art. It is rigorously a masterpiece. This is literally what you would expect from a movie budget. Character : 9/10 Sure, the anime's genre is ""Slice Of Life"" which means that it mostly focuses on the main character's development. However, some other important people within the anime are lacking character developments. For an example, Hodgins. He deserved more CD. Other than that, the main character, Violet Evergarden's character development was flawless. Sound : 8/10 Both the opening and ending, as well as the soundtracks within this anime is ""all right"". But it could've been better, sometimes the soundtrack in emotional moments are more like a background music instead of it expressing the condition of the scene. Enjoyment : 10/10 This show is a perfection, I enjoyed it while it lasted. The main character is similar to me in real life, and it really touches me to see her develop as time passes.

320415,513,Tenkuu no Shiro Laputa,"['Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Sci-Fi']",255742,387,179.0,7.0,"This is Hayao Miyazaki’s second major movie after Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind (he also did Castle of Cagliostro but that is just a Lupin the 3rd side story so I don’t count it as major). This time he went for something much lighter than a grim post-apocalyptic setting; it is a lot more conventional and easy-going so I hardly enjoyed it as much as Nausicaa. The story is a rather standard children’s adventure with steampunk elements; two kids have this magic stone and they want to find a floating island before greedy men use it for evil reasons. The setting is close to the late 1800’s, when mankind had begun using flying machines and the need for a material that can allow floating was the most important thing. The heroine has a medallion that points to the relics of an ancient civilization, which had achieved that. It is hardly as complicating as Nausicaa, for an anti-war movie, nobody dies despite the constant destructions and explosions, and for a pro-ecology movie they hardly show the love towards nature. Not to mention the kiddie romance. It feels a lot like a stupid anime romcom, as the girl literally just drops into the boy’s life and he does all sorts of stupid things while trying to impress her… including trying to protect her. GAH! The ending is also quite rushed and weak in overall, as the main conflict was solved in a most simplistic and cop-out manner. Skipping that, most of the duration of the film is one big chase, where things constantly demolish or blow up. It is quite spectacular and really close to the great choreographies Miyazaki worked with in Cagliostro or his even older minor contribution in Future Boy Conan. Miyazaki loves the feeling of flight, and thus there are numerous scenes of interesting looking flying machines. The feeling of exploration and wonder is all over the place; which is a big plus. The problem is that, again, because of the light nature of the story the characters are also … light. The medallion is making them float every time they drop from a high place, which not only saves them numerous times but also gives them a huge advantage over their opponents. Felt very cheap, since they weren’t even actively aware of how to use it and it was simply working on its own. The characters are very basic and despite filling their roles nicely they never manage to be anything more than archetypes. You already know the deal, the frail girl with the mystic power, the silly boy with the heart of gold, the serious scheming army men, the comical pirates, and so on. A funny thing about them is some of their names which had to be changed in many languages because they sounded like a bad word. It isn’t hard to imagine what “Sheeta” or “Laputa” means, right? Despite the “by the book” screenplay, Laputa is still an above average film for its good production values and its constant action scenes. Nothing feels out of place or useless, and the cast is likable without excelling in anything in particular. A good time-spender but hardly leaves something to think about afterwards.

Watching this anime made me feel like I was killing brain cells luckily I survived. First off I give the story a 3 It has some potential to be good but it was executed pretty badly and rushed. I didn't like the reason why there was a war because of 1 person I thought that was pretty stupid. I also thought there was too much story and not enough episodes, almost like they didn't have enough money to keep going. You got Mui trying to save her brother, Takashi's problems with his family, The war between the magicians and trailers or whatever the hell they were called, Takashi being brought into the magic world, 2 girls fighting over him, and the list goes on. It was poorly done in my opinion and they should have added less plot. Art - 4 The art was okay but could have been more original. The characters didn't look very unique they just looked average. Sound - 8 The only thing good about this anime was the fact Nano sung the ending which sounded very good but sad to see it being used in this anime. Character - 3 I felt no connection to the characters at all. The only character I felt sorry for was Gekkou because Takashi was a piece of sh*t towards him and he just takes it like they're in an abusive relationship and forgives him so easily even though he was a b*tch and shoved him into a car because someone apparently told him to. The kid can't even make choices on his own and he's a weak character. He thinks his mom abuses him even though she was helping him get stronger. Takashi is the definition of a brat. The blonde haired girl is too dam clingy, I was hoping she would go for Gekkou but she's too stupid and falls in love with Takashi even though he's a brat pretending to date her like a little b*tch that he is throughout the whole series. Mui fell in love with Takashi too easily, I see nothing special about him, he claims his mom hates him and he tried to kill his brother and wonders why his brother hates him. Lastly there's Kazumi Ida, I see nothing cool about him that's really all I can say because he really had no involvement in the anime, he wasn't needed at all.

Hayao Miyazaki also worked on this show. He did the layout for it. Akage no Anne is an adaptation of the novel Anne of Green Gables by L.M. Montgomery. It was aired on something called Sekai Meisaku Gekijō (World Masterpiece Theater) which is a Japanese TV anime staple that showcased an animated version of a different classical book or story. Akage no Anne is the story of an 11-year-old orphan girl with a vast imagination and short temper. She ends up being taken into the Cuthbert house in Avonlea. Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert originally wanted to adopt a boy to help Matthew out on the farm, but they got sent Anne Shirley by a mistake, but they decided to keep her anyway, even though they do not officially adopt her. The show follows Anne from when she is 11 years old, until she is 17 years old. I am a big fan of coming of age stories. It is why Aria is my favorite anime. This show is yet another coming of age story that I really enjoyed. Seeing Anne grow up and having to face everything life could throw at her was quite the ride. It was nice and relaxing when it wanted to, but the show could also really hit you like a brick. The music was good and really fit the show, and the animation was ok for the most part. It was not incredible, but it never really needed to. It did have a few moments where the animation was not at its best, but this is also a 50 episode long show, so it is not a huge surprise. I do however have to give a huge shoutout to the backgrounds. The backgrounds were completely painted with watercolor, and they looked absolutely fantastic. I just wanna frame them and put them on my wall. Akage no Anne was the second best show I have watched from the 70s. The way the show portrayed how bonds were forming between Anne, Marilla and Matthew was just fantastic. It also did a really good job showcasing how Anne grew, not just physically, but also mentally. She became more independent and mature. Akage no Anne is honestly one of the best coming of age stories I have seen.

I have watched the original anime not to long ago, thus it helps comparing both... They both start the story by introducing guts during a castle siege where he takes on the resident ""monster"". The animation during this part was brilliant giving a lot of realism to the siege and the battles being fought, this remains thorough the movie, characters animation also look fantastic and fluid..... The art, is the main issue with this faithful remake, Griffith only lacks sparkles in his air to complete the picture, characters despite being well animated, look somewhat plain and when animated in 3d might look awkward, there is a frontal full nude scene of Casca, this i remember from the series, i believe Casca's skin had a darker tone and was much more detailed and appealing as a women, in the movie i fell some detail was lost and even some charm... Besides the small issue with characters, background art looks stunning... Someone said on a review, music is inferior to the original, what i feel is that music sounds appropriate but somewhat too grandiose... I think the last thing to talk about is the entire new cast, an experienced viewer should have no trouble identifying the entire cast, they are all veteran's of modern anime, but they wont cut for the job and lack the ""strenght"" the old cast added to characters like Guts or Casca, i believe Casca is the one who lost the most with all the changes, even Aki Toyosaki is now voicing Charlot, who would have thought, although she is maturing nicely (Aki's), im not sure she is suited for a damsel in distress, i think i hear her screaming for the first time and it's not my mind playin tricks... Anyway, ANN says this covers from mid vol 4 to vol 6 or about 2 volumes, story had to be somewhat rushed and overall from a technical standpoint it is a good works that shines sometimes but it is lackluster at the same time... It might work better for first time viewers, it works for me although not entirely and die hard fans, haters gonna hate and thats how it is...

While it has a stronger start than the former, and while it is littered with better animation and more charismatic characters, there is something about it that just doesn’t hold up to the first. The concept of the arcade machine is intriguing and the tactics used in that arc are nothing short of brilliant, but it is the fact that the arc dragged on for so long and the episodic structure became about finding a way to beat the machine and the old man, that it became redundant to sit through. The first season of Kaiji, while having a weak start, managed to flip everything on it’s head and change it’s formula multiple times so that it could become a refreshing ride. This stuck with one thing and repeated it over and over again until became predictable as to what would happen, and that is: Kaiji coming up with a genius plan, the men at the arcade owning Kaiji and beating his plans, Kaiji retreating to come up with a better plan, and the old man laughing at Kaiji. Rinse and repeat. Moreover, the ending is not good or unique like the first ending in the first season of Kaiji. Without going into needless spoilers, the first season’s ending was both immensely cathartic and very unique and one of a kind, hard to find elsewhere. This season’s ending was lackluster and felt really bland and generic. Not really a bad ending, but it left a bitter taste in my mouth as opposed to the first season’s unique end. It does have a moral message and delivers it’s theme quite well, but it just feels mundane and more like a dues ex machina than a natural ending. The final villain in the first season was better than the one here, which added more spice to the payoff of the first season. The audiovisuals are great, though I miss the beautiful melodies of the first season which were more visceral to Kaiji’s whole experience. Tracks such as Chorus, which elevated the mood from fun poker to instant sense of danger are missing here. The animation has not changed, and Madhouse is as consistent here as the first season, so that is something good. Kaiji’s second season does not quite reach the peak of the first season, but it still does solid in most of what it achieves. Good music, nice visuals, and tactics that were brilliant and well thought out, though took really long to give the viewer a payoff.

This is both a blessing and a curse; whilst this does mean that more people watch these (usually pretty amazing) films, it also means that people can mistake 'imperfect' for 'bad.' I can't speak for everyone, but I actually really enjoyed From Up on Poppy Hill. The characters were likeable - not particularly in-depth or rich, but likeable - and the quirky supporting cast were always there to pick up any slack. In fact, I would say that the supporting cast is one of my favourites from a Ghibli film so far, beautifully designed and entertaining to watch. The story was engaging, too: a simple teenage romance with a couple of surprising plot twists and an ultimately uplifting result. It may not have been full of drama and suspense, but the film had that wonderful Ghibli charm to it, reminding me of some of their other simpler works: Only Yesterday and Whisper of the Heart (the latter being a personal all-time favourite). Whilst the plot may have been slow-moving, a faster one wasn't really required. The world of the story was, as always, built beautifully, and it was a pleasure to watch events unfold even when they were unfolding quite cautiously. This, of course, was because of the astounding artwork, backgrounds and animation more than anything. There's not really anything more to say on this, it's just beautiful. The music also deserves a mention. The opening and closing songs were lovely, very fitting and atmospheric, and whilst I can't really pinpoint a specific part of the background OST that I enjoyed, I can safely say that it always suited the scene it was played against, whether or not it was anything particularly special. I was also pleasantly surprised at how good the English dubbed voice acting was, for the most part. (I can't comment on the original Japanese as I didn't watch it). So, to summarise; this film isn't for everyone. It doesn't have a very describable plot, nor does it have any particular deep characterisation or meaning (unless I was missing something). It's comparable to a nice soup in winter; it might not be the most exciting or substantial thing ever, but it's comforting and sympathetic and it makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Unless, of course, you don't like soup. But anyway, you get my point. It's not the best work ever to come from Ghibli, but it's still a lovely film, it has an irresistible charm and it's definitely worth a watch.

When you first see this anime you may think ""Yeah, this is the kind of cliche anime that every anime season has"", but in my opinion you are wrong if you thought that, personally I was wrong too, I admit, I thought it was the same cliche of always, but it ended up being an anime way more interesting. The story takes place in a fictionary world, where there are ancient weapons, named Drag-Ride that are ancient mechanical weapons. Five years ago, the protagonist, named Lux Arcadia, was the prince of the Empire, and he also was known as the strongest Drag-Knight, the Empire was destroyed due to a revolt, now Lux is known as the ""Weakest Undefeated"", the Drag-Knight who doesn't attack. Due to some reasons Lux ends up entering a girl's school that raises Drag-Knights. This is the story, not bad thought, if it was a little more serious I think it could've been an anime that would please more audience than this, one problem is how ridiculous things end up happening and how all the girls want so bad the protagonist, but if you think about it, it's very common in the harem anime genres, not saying that it explains why, I think if a harem is built in the correct way it can be good, sadly it wasn't the case. The art of the anime has many 3D aspects, which may be a little unpleasant for some people, some parts I think the art was very strange and bad, but nothing that displeased me so much, the art was most part of the time OK, the fighting scenes were all OK too. About the sound, I can't really say if it was good or bad, it didn't caught my attention enough to make an opinion, so I will just say it's OK too, I also liked the OP, it gets in your head, the ED was also very good, singed by the group nano.RIPE that I personally like very much. If I have to say something about the characters is that, yes they are cliche, there are all of the types of girls that almost every harem anime has, but that is almost a standard of harem animes. So I really think that the characters are not bad at all, I liked even some of the supporting characters, maybe more than some main characters, lol. They all have some interesting story about their pasts, and their personalities and ways of acting didn't displeased me at all. If I have to choose if I enjoyed it or not, I would really say I enjoyed, the beggining may not catch your attention, even I thought about dropping it in the beggining, but I don't regret not dropping it, if it gets a second season in the future I will watch, if you dropped and are reading this, I advise you to give it another chance, you may end up liking it, just like me.

This anime had all of it. Everything. Except sound, which there were few good tracks of but a kind of mediocre OP and ED. That is where my criticism ends. Everything else was top notch. The story is realistic, and goes over character flaws and their mundane lives very well and still manages to slowly introduce this enticing plot about terrorists advocating for the ethics of space colonisation when Earth isn't optimised yet. This anime portrays characters in such a realistic fashion and in such variety it's almost frightening.

73715,13029,Arashi no Yoru ni: Himitsu no Tomodachi,"['Adventure', 'Drama']",2104,7842,4235.0,6.0,"I still start by saying that it is impossible for me to give a completely unbiased review of this series, given my efforts in the English dub of the original movie that preceded the series. ""Arashi no Yoru ni: Himitsu no Tomodachi"" is another realisation of the story based on the original series of childrens books written over fifteen years ago now. The story is basic enough: A goat and a wolf befriend each other whilst taking shelter from a storm, and due to the dark environment and lack of ability to smell each other, they resort to having a conversation that sees them discover they have a lot in common. They only discover their differences in species when they meet again the following day, but the choose to pursue their friendship rather than let base instinct get the better of them. Where the series differs from the books and the movie is that Mei, who was originally cast as male in the movie and always seen as male by the author of the books, has now become May, a female goat. This was probably done for marketing purposes to appeal to a larger audience, as well as to quash the more homoerotic undertones that the original story suffered from (through no fault of the story or movie itself, morseco thanks to the attention it received from people who wished to see such in the story, most notably in the furry fandom.) I find this a disappointing change, as it actually leaves the interpretation of May and Gabu's relationship as being more a romance than a friendship, particularly in the way some episodes depict interaction between the two. The visuals are bright, cheery, and appealing to younger audiences; all the characters have a very neotenic style, especially the goats, though even Ghiro looks quite tame compared to his movie counterpart. The backgrounds are beautifully rendered, but the animation at times can be stilted, the goats' anatomy lookng downright weird at times. The series is also clearly aimed at a much younger audience, with the English dialogue very slow and simplified, likely to assist with youngsters wishing to learn English. Whilst the voices are acceptable, it lacks the flow and greater expression of the Japanese dub, even though the animation is tailored to synchronise with the English dub. The soundtrack also re-uses substantial amounts of the orchestral soundtrack written for the original movie, with other incidental music sounding much cheaper for the rest of the time. The series, running at 26 episodes, only covers the original story up to about book 4 of the original 7-book series, and re-writes certain scenes from both the books and the movies, using elements of the later books but in reference to other characters. Why this was done is unclear, as the current series has an extremely open ending and feel incomplete as it stands, with no resolution to the actions of certain characters. Whether or not this indicates there will be a second season of the show is unknown, but as it stands the conclusion to the series is quite unsatisfying in its attempt to wrap things up. Overall, I give it a 6 out of 10. It has its heartwarming moments, and the story is still touching, but it is lacking in a great many ways compared to the original story books and movie adaptation.

But the story is set up on a group of people in a mage guild named Fairy Tail, where the series main topic probably is friendship between them. With at story like this, not having any special plot actually works. Instead of plot, we have fun and interesting small arcs all the time, which never makes Fairy Tail boring! And we all have to remember that Fairy Tail is still on-going, and there is lot of unanswered questions yet to figure out, so it is possible for a deeper plot to pop up in the end! Art: Here i must compare a little to the Manga (Sorry). The manga have AMAZING art, however the animation in the manga is not near as good. This is also the main reason why i won't give this anime a overall score on 10. To be honest, when i watched the first episode of Fairy Tail in 2009, i have been looking forward for it to air the whole day, and i was a little disappointed when i watched it. worse was it, that from episode 2 and on to episode 15-20, the animation keept being bad, well, the little animation there where! Fairy Tail, both in openings/endings and in the episodes themself like to use A LOT of non-moving pictures, which is a shame, because fairy tail haves potentiale to have some really kick ass scenes. The fights lack a little too compared to the manga, or just other shounen series, because of the BLOOD censur (which annoys be greatly! We can not show blood in the anime, but naked girls is no problem!) however, the anime still manages to have some good fights, where the Erza arc was animated pretty good, and so some of the other big fights. also, a lot of people have been talking about Fairy Tail being a rip off or copy from One Piece. that is deffintly not true! Yes, the art is somewhat similar and yes both series are a lot about their ""nakamas"" for really, its two very different stories. Try sit down and read shojo, i can find over 10 stories with different mangakas, but with similar art and story. Fairy Tail and One Piece are NOT the same, Fairy Tail is NOT a rip off, DON'T compare them, seriously .. Sound: Fairy Tail have without doubt the most EPIC soundtracks! It makes you go ""hell yeah, go fairy tail"" everytime the main theme for their fighting scenes plays, and it makes you cry, when the sad themes are played during sad scenes. Fairy Tail also have an amazing Voice Acting cast (In japanese) with some of the very popular seiyuu's, like Happy's voice actor Kugimiya Rie (Alphonse, Taiga, Shana, Louise, etc) and Lucy's voice actor Hirano Aya (Suzumiya Haruhi, Izumi Konata, etc) and my own favorites, Natsu and Gray's voice actors Kakihara Tetsuya (Simon, Amaimon, etc) and Nakamura Yuuichi (Tomoya, Greed, Gai, Ikuto, etc) and there are a lot more amazing voice actors, but that would be too much to list here now. Go check out for yourself! Character: There are a lot of characters in Fairy Tail, it should be possible to at least find a few you would like. To me, all the characters are very likeable, i specially like our Main hero Natsu, because he seems bold, but he actually isn't stupid or slow or dense like other typical shounen heros are. Also with our characters, fairy tail manage to create some interesting relationships between our characters, both deep friendship, but also romantic ones, which usally is really rare in shounen. I'm sure that there haven't been lots of girls, watching series like Bleach, One Piece or Naruto and just wishing for some romantic relationships to happen. Well i will say that Fairy Tail manages to give you - maybe not fully canon - but surely lots of romantic possible relationship. Enjoyment: Unless you really have a problem with half naked girls and breasts, which you really cannot escape from in Fairy tail however much i wish for it, it should not be possible for anyone to not enjoy this anime! It is just hilarious and funny but still have its good and serious moments, and even some complicated relationships between some of our characters, and Fairy Tail manage to surprise me lots of times too! I will reccomend this anime to all people who like shounen, or like a fun anime with lots of comedy. There might be some girls, like myself, who doesn't find the fan service rather interesting (Yes - boobs, huge boobs and LOTS of them) but i myself just learned to look over it, since most of the times, this fanservice is invovled with something funny, which really just makes you laugh of it anyway. For guys who like this kind of fan service.. so much more reason for you to watch it! All in all. Wanna watch a funny, interesting and good anime? Watch Fairy Tail. And if you like fairy tail, i would really reccomend reading the Manga too. But that would mostly be because of the fact that the art is awesome, and manga contains blood, which makes the fighting scenes look a little more badass, and characters like Gray, is often drawn very hot and cool in the manga, where he get less epic moments in the Anime. Other than that, the Anime and Manga is pretty much the same, i'm surprised to have watched 119 episodes of Fairy Tail, and there haven't been any massive fillers yet. i will believe there have been all in all 10 episodes out of the 119 which have contained fillers, and that was not BAD fillers, and it wasn't 10 episodes in a row, so it made a annoying filler arc. Also the Fairy Tail anime likes to animate some of the many Fairy Tail Special/Extra/Omakes chapters and put them into the series or create some amazing hilarious OVA episodes out of them.

283126,37095,"Violet Evergarden: Kitto ""Ai"" wo Shiru Hi ga Kuru no Darou","['Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Slice of Life']",101893,1087,188.0,8.0,"Before I start this review, I'll just tell you this: this is separate from the sequel movie announced by KyoAni. The movie is scheduled to be released in January 2020. Also, I wrote this review assuming you watched the 13 episode series first. If you haven't please watch that first (though I doubt anyone would come here without watching the main series first). While doing so I'd recommend you to watch this between episodes 4 and 5 since that's when this is set. Violet Evergarden Special is an unaired episode which is set between episodes 4 and 5 of the 13 episode series - between Iris' visit to her hometown and the one involving Princess Charlotte's exchange of letters with the neighboring country's prince. No wonder there was a time gap of a few months between those 2 adventures. Since this happens in the first half of the series we don't get any information about Gilbert's situation after the war. Therefore he does not appear (in a flashback yes, but it was shown before). In addition, for those wanting to know whether this episode has adapted part of the LN, this is an original episode. Story: 8 Now, just because this is 34 minutes long does not mean that there's not much to say. In fact, this is probably one of the most important (personally one of the best for me) episodes in the series. The main reason is because this is when we can clearly see Violet struggling to write a letter for her client. In fact, it's the first time that Violet is taking care of a client all by herself (though technically she does get some help - after all, she's not experienced at this point). It also explains the time gap between episodes 4 and 5 - how did Violet manage to get a chance to write letters for a princess only after a few months from graduating? The episode involved Violet writing a love letter for an opera singer. Bearing in mind that Violet is still in her learning stages for writing letters, we are shown her struggles a number of times, which is pretty obvious since Violet still doesn't know what 'I love you ' means. She manages to get help from her colleagues to improve and meet the singer's expectations. Just like other episodes about Violet's adventures, we get a glimpse of the client's past, which involves the painful loss of her love partner during the war. I won't spoil beyond this point, but you should probably know the conclusion from most of Violet's other adventures. But how does this answer the question I mentioned before? Well, since Violet learns how to write love letters here, this is probably the main reason why her writing skills were significantly better than before in episode 5. It also partly explains why Hodgins chose her to handle an important client like Princess Charlotte - Cattleya was writing on the other side while Iris and Erica probably didn't have any experience writing love letters for important clients like Violet. ""Violet. I know this is no easy task, but you've completed a great many jobs over the past few months."" - Claudia Hodgins, start of Episode 5 One of the ""great many jobs"" included this episode. Now some people may say that this isn't enough, which I perfectly understand, but 1 episode is better than none. If I was to point out a major flaw, it would be the teacher's recommendation for Violet to write the letters. I mean, she only saw Violet write one letter... I don't think that would have been enough to be so sure to take care of a hard task like this. Overall, I'll give an 8 for bridging the time gap. Art: 10 Maybe it's just me but watching this after almost 2 months since the main series finished made me appreciate the art a lot more. I'm no expert in art, but everything was flawless to me, maybe even too flawless. My favorite parts were the water fountain scene and the candles. Just can't get enough of them. Sound: 7 A new addition in terms of sound is the singing of the opera singer - her voice was really overwhelming and managed to captivate the audience's attention, including me. Character: 8 Without this episode, Violet's development would've had a huge gap in her path to improve her writing skills. This was a massive plus for me and it's also why I give an 8 for character. Some people might argue that whilst this episode did help to cement the cracks of her development, the pace at which this occurs may still be too quick. I think it's understandable since all of her adventures involving clients are only 20 minutes long. This leads me to Irma's character. Since she was a client it's obvious that there was a lack of development. I think this was the weakest part of this episode, even more so than others because her flashbacks felt too short for me to feel much sympathy for her. Maybe it's because VE has always been using the loss of loved ones on most of its episodes - Violet losing Gilbert, Oscar losing his daughter, Anne losing her mother... Enjoyment: 8 I personally think this episode should've been included in the main series in the first place, to bridge the time gap between Violet's first and second adventures, which could have reduced complaints by some people questioning Violet's quick growth. Regardless, I still enjoyed this episode. Overall - 8 Would recommend, though you may not be satisfied.

With perhaps the most poorly paced story I've seen in years, shallow characters, a mediocre style, and middle-school level psychological aspects which are made to be a big deal, this series fell flat on it's face for me, almost completely. The protagonist named Kaiji works a minimum wage job. He's such an intelligent guy that he manages to get himself into a ton of debt with the Yakuza by being his friend's guarantor for a 300,000 Yen loan. With the ridiculous interest on that loan, it quickly becomes over 3 million yen. Then the protagonist demonstrates further intelligence by joining a gambling cruise with promises to eliminate that loan. Thus begins the story, involving various gambling and psychology elements. It's not a bad premise entirely. It's just executed very poorly. First, the pacing is something awful. In the first game, they are given a deck of cards with rock/paper/scissors to play against other duelists in the battle for star chips which are worth money. The cruise is 4 hours long. It takes about 10 episodes to finish the cruise, but mind you the last 20 minutes of the cruise last two or three episodes themselves. I had serious DBZ 5 minute-Namek deja vu when the characters were talking about how only 17 minutes remained, then proceeded to spend NEARLY FIFTEEN MINUTES discussing what they should do next. By the end of the episode, only two or three minutes passed on the timer. Grandpa without his walking stick can move faster. Then there's the fact that while some psychological aspects are interesting, many more are just too basic, or something that can easily figured out by a middle schooler (which they proceed to explain for the next 60-120 seconds). Some are even nonsensical. Kaiji proclaims by just looking at a guy that he can tell he's a ""balanced"" type of thinker. Hey Kaiji, how about putting those prophetic powers to use and instead not sign a shady loan agreement? Even more so: When the first game is practically over, Kaiji assaults three other players, stealing all of their cash/valuables. He does so for some reasons, but why do the guards allow this when they wouldn't let him do so earlier? Earlier he assaulted another player and was promptly stopped. Other than Kaiji being a dunce a lot of the time and other times outwitting the opposition when the plot calls for it, there are no noteworthy characters. They are pretty much all shallowly greedy characters, with no real history or motivation or anything noteworthy about their design. The art style will be a huge turn off for some, even if it didn't bother me much. Characters have weirdly shaped heads, eyes, and everyone has a big nose. There is nothing memorable about the music or voice acting or sound effects either. Nothing memorable in either department. I didn't finish the series because by midway through the second game, I was sick of the crappy pacing where they take an entire episode just to explain some rules, have some nonsensical dialogue, and then end the episode with whatever conclusion they came to, or to set up the drama for the proceeding episode. No character is remotely interesting, with grown men crying every episode. The art style didn't bother me personally so much but it will definitely be a turn off for some. Only a few neat gambling/psychological elements resonate strongly, but it isn't enough to override the overall stench of this series. Pros: +Some good psychological aspects +Decent premise Cons: -Awful pacing -While some psychological aspects are good, many more are too basic/elementary -Shallow characters -Art style may be a turn off Helpful",3682,Negative,Negative,"Poor pacing, shallow characters, and mediocre style mar the series' potential.","{""sentiment"":""Negative"",""summary"":""Poor pacing, shallow characters, and mediocre style mar the series' potential.""}"

Story: I thought the story was quite good, though it does not top the original SAC story, it did make quite an impression however. There were plenty of twists in the story to keep you guessing all the way till the end. One thing to look out for is the explaining, they usually spend a decent amount of time explaining situations, so be prepared for lots of dialog. Art: well its GitS, the art is very good and fluid, considering that it gets about 30million yen/ episode budget. The backgrounds and scenes are colorful and rich, they almost always fit the mood as well. Sound: there are no complaints on part of the sound, the opening and closing are pretty catchy. The BGM is usually right on the spot. Characters: All the characters all get some time in the limelight, so you learn even more about them. you wont really find any shallow characters in GitS, all of them have unique personalities and pasts.

I'm sure if I were to read the manga I would probably appreciate it much more. I'm a very large fan of the chibi art style for most of the characters and the environment is very beautiful. I'm also a huge fun of WWII themes, which is what drew me into this anime in the first place. The two main characters Yuu and Chito are very cute and had me caring about them the whole time. The soundtrack for this anime is fantastic. I never skipped the OP (Ugoku, Uguko) but I cannot say the same for the ED. However, my favorite track from the soundtrack would have to be Amadare no Uta.

38477,9922,Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai: Under the Innocent Sky.,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Ecchi', 'Harem', 'Romance']",69585,1509,4758.0,5.0,"Once upon a time the world considered mental illness to be a taboo subject, so much so that those who suffered were often shunned or locked away, and it was often the case that stories dealing with the issue were thought of as ... controversial. Nowadays there is greater understanding of the ailments of the mind, and with that has come a rise in the number of tales featuring the subject as a central theme. That said, there is a tendency to focus on clinical depression, schizophrenia, psychosis, and other well known illnesses, which may seem a little odd until one realises that the most commonly fictionalised ailments have one underlying connection - they all made the national news. The press is rife with tales of psychopaths, suicides, serial killers and more, and while there are stories that are based on one (or more), of the lesser known mental illnesses, the majority of authors and screenwriters will immediately utilise those that the public finds familiar. Based on the eroge of the same name by Navel, Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai (We Without Wings) – Under the Innocent Sky (or OreTsuba as it's more commonly known), follows the daily lives of Haneda Takashi, Chitose Shuusuke and Narita Hayato, three young men living in the city of Yanagihara. Each leads a life that is very different to the other two, and at first they seem to have no connection to one another ... And that's about as clear as things get for quite a few episodes. From the outset there's no apparent direction or focus to the plot, and this continues until late in the series, at which point the shape of a storyline begins to appear. Now given the ultimate focus of the narrative one might argue that the somewhat dizzying sequence of events during the first half of OreTsuba are a purposeful attempt to elicit a sympathetic reaction from the audience by making them confused and uncomfortable. Unfortunately that sort of reasoning is a bit too far fetched in the cold light of day as the story appears to have been written by someone with little to no knowledge of mental illness whatsoever. In addition to that one does have to question the sanity of the person who decided an ecchi, harem romantic comedy was the best vehicle for a narrative where the core themes are not only being mentally ill, but also how it affects those around you. Speaking of harems ... OreTsuba features an array of characters who are paraded across the screen like pedigrees at a dog show, and the sheer number can initially seem impressive until one realises that the majority of them are nothing more than window dressing. There's little in the way of actual development going on, which wouldn't be a bad thing if some effort had been put into defining the characters from the start, so it's unfortunate that this is yet another anime populated by cardboard cutouts. Even worse is that almost every opportunity for growth or added definition during the first half of the series is wasted on stock events that grace many an ecchi harem tale, and while the latter portion of the story does present a few interesting scenarios, these are not enough to raise the show from mediocrity. If nothing else, OreTsuba is consistent in that the generic characters and plot tokens are very clearly reflected in the acting, and unrealistic voices abound in this series. The lead roles seem to lose interest in the project after the first episode and appear to perform little more than lines by rote for the rest of the series, but maybe it's not the fault of the seiyuu as the dialogue is sorely lacking in originality and imagination. This apparent lack of creativity also extends to the music, and many of the background tracks are of the type that one might find in just about every other ecchi harem romantic comedy, including the pieces used in Gretagard. The opening and ending themes are no better, and OreTsuba manages to uphold the best traditions of eroge and dating sim adaptations by finding the most generic J-pop tracks it can for the series OP and ED. Now given that this is an adaptation there's an inherent limitation placed on design, and while that isn't necessarily a bad thing for some shows, viewers should remember what the source material actually is. The problem is that OreTsuba, like so many other eroge and datings sims, uses a stock set of character designs that have gone beyond a simple stereotype, and are now more of a hallmark for these types of story. In addition to this the animation is workman-like, and that blandness is most prominent when the character are undertaking some sort of frenetic activity. In all honesty Nomad, like so many studios before them, appear to have been unable to muster the effort to produce a good looking series. On a side note, one of the most annoying things about OreTsuba is that the visuals sometimes show a few flashes of original thinking, but these moments are often derailed or buried completely by the sudden and pointless introduction of fanservice. There are far too many occasions where events are progressing in an interesting manner when all of a sudden the screen is covered with underwear or jiggling ... things. So is OreTsuba enjoyable? Well, the story lacks any real charm or grace and the core theme has been handled in a far more sensitive manner by Mahoraba ~Heartful Days~. In addition to that, the seemingly mindless adherence to the stereotypical production methods of eroge and datings sim adaptations and the overabundance of pointless fanservice actually detract from any efforts to move the plot in a more meaningful direction. The simple fact is that OreTsuba is about as subtle and sensitive as a hammer to the face, and one event in particular highlights this as there's nothing in the series up to that point to justify the sudden revelation that one of the characters had an imaginary little brother. OreTsuba is a singular example of pretty much everything that's wrong with the anime industry these days, which is actually the only good thing about it. Watching the series is far more work than it should be, and while the source material appears to have been written and designed by people who like to wear jackets with lots of straps and really long sleeves, that's no excuse for a poorly executed adaptation. There are many ways the series could have been handled (as Tears To Tiara proved), but it looks like nobody really cared enough about this anime to make the effort. So the only question left is why on earth was it made in the first place?

Story: Rating- Not Applicable - Since Hetalia doesn't really follow any plot or have a presentation that has a purpose of following a sequential narrative, it will be only fair to put the story rating into ""not applicable"". Art: 8 - The character illustrations and animation are crisper, more detailed and had a lot more differentiation than they got in the past seasons. The background is still a bit dull. However, it's good that it does compliment the main subject and makes good of its purpose of not taking the viewer's attention away from the characters. - They still make use of the swirl and grunge-like type of textured backgrounds to aid the sudden mood change of a character. In the past, it is observable how it lacked artistry in its design but it's all nice to see that they had put a lot more effort in making them this season. - In respect to the episodes with scenery, landscapes and architecture in them. It is noticeable that the illustrators still fell flat on these areas. The building awnings, doors and windows still appeared inorganic just like in the past seasons. Anyone familiar with the detailed Mont Saint-Michel would notice how the Hetalia version of it lacked architectural details. Sound: 8 - The voice actors are spot on for their characters and delivers quite great just like they always had. The opening theme is new and still grows a bit tediously annoying as time goes by and it might only make a viewer skip it out. - It can be heard that there are quite a few new themes thrown in for the characters (like something that sounds like Mozart's Turkish March at one scene where Turkey was shown) but apart from that, they still used almost the same character themes for the most part. - The new ending theme (Mawaru Chikyuu Rondo) was indeed fun, softer and a bit more balanced-sounding than Marukaite Chikyuu and Hatafutte Parade. However, it doesn't sound as catchy. Character: 7 - The characters are still funny and in-character as they have ever been. In respect to the real main characters, each of them still holds this strong and noteworthy personality that is unique to them. It is also great to see that France's character got a lot more depth this season than in the past. There were a few new characters that had a debut appearance this season. Enjoyment: 10 - Hetalia: The Beautiful World is still effectively comedic like how its precursors were. It still makes watchers laugh their hearts out loud and as a bonus, it even includes a few more surprising scenes that are fanservice-like (i.e showing of skin etc). Overall: 8 - Overall, it is still an excellent watch for those people who have always enjoyed what Hetalia is— a silly, lighthearted allegory of different cultures, historical trivias and world views that will add a little bit of knowledge in a fun way. It is also recommended for people who appreciates this type of work and to those who are open to see an animation work that is a bit different from the others. However, to those who take a little harmless national and cultural satire a bit too seriously, I will only advise you to pick another title.

It starts off with Touma facing off against them as always but what I particularly like about this season so far are how multiple protagonists are popping up. In fact, I think this is the first time we have so many character perspectives in a single season. FYI this season alongside Touma we are getting two new protagonists, Accelerator and Hamazura. There's, of course, the usual amalgamation of pacing problems, completely new characters that end up fighting and killing without any explanation. The character introduction scenes have been cut short is what I can tell as an Anime-only viewer. Particularly if you ask me the episodes 4-6 were a mess, but if you are the kind of viewer who follows every single dialogue like me then it isn't much of a problem as the essence of the arcs are conveyed.

The main protagonist is Umaru, a character who seems to be the perfect high school student when outside, but actually turns into a lazy and spoiled chibi when she returns home. Supposedly everything about her seems perfect, including grades and looks, something that contradicts the fact that she runs on coke and potato chips and spends all of her time watching anime and playing games. Giving the story a 5 is more than enough, such a simple plot could give the writers many opportunities but they didn't care enough. Umaru is the worst character in the show. The rest of the cast is amazing compared to her (or at least some of the cast). Umaru's big brother, Taihei, is her baby sitter with no backbone and always buys her shit after she throws a tantrum or two. Ebina is the shy friend of the protagonist and everyone in this community loves her because she's a walking definition of fanservice for people who like shy girls. Sylphinford is very energetic and wants to be number one but Umaru takes her place for some reason. Kirie is a dumbass with a scary face. The rest of the cast does not concern you because they are not important. Characters get a 5 for being generic though some are better than others. Art style gets a 7 for being good. Sound gets a 3 cause the BGM is terrible (it fits the show perfectly). You'll understand once you hear it. I did not enjoy this show and my standards are low. The jokes weren't funny, the protagonist was annoying, there was hardly any character development (even though there's a season 2 coming out soon and hopefully there will be something interesting happening between the characters) and the way the main character got away with literally everything made each character's behavior unreasonably stupid. Enjoyment gets a 3. Overall I give this show a 4. As bad as the show is it's definitely iconic in a way, since it has created a billions of reaction images, each one used way too much of course, and most people in the anime community have seen ""that hamster thing, right?"" at least once. Should you watch this? Probably, it may be a terrible show but it can serve as a good example of terrible shows that got very popular. Also it's important to watch popular anime so you can understand why it got popular and learn more about the anime community as a whole.

213008,552,Digimon Adventure,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Kids']",274830,356,783.0,7.0,"Warning: This review contains some spoilers. First impressions: As a kid that grew up in the 90s, I’m pretty sure I speak for most people that grew up in that period when I say that if there’s one question we’ve been asked, it’s “Are you a Digimon or Pokemon fan?”. In most playgrounds that was one of the most popular debates around, and still is today. Digimon or Pokemon? To which I’m going to have to say Digimon, because as part of the generation that watched Digimon when it was first released for western audiences, I didn’t have anything else to watch. Story: 7/10 Digimon Adventure centres around a group of kids that are transported from the real world to a digital one. It’s in this digital world that they discover the digimon, the creatures that inhabit it, each getting a digimon partner to protect them as they explore it. When looked at with even a marginally experienced eye, it’s clear that the story of Digimon Adventure plays out like your typical JRPG. You have stuff like your chosen ones, or the call to save innocents from some impending evil. Even if you didn't grow up watching digimon, or have any knowledge of the franchise, it’s easy to label the show as simple entertainment for kids. However the series has a lot more going for it than what first meets the eye. What starts as a show about a bunch of kids with pet monsters exploring and saving a new world from evil, ends as something much more conceptually and tonally synthetic. Quite a few of the episodes deal with the idea of alternate realities. There’s even one episode where Tai gets transported back to the real world, only to conclude that he isn’t where he’s supposed to be, heeding a greater calling instead. Another aspect that elevates the story from its base premise is the level of realism that the series sporadically displays. Many of the fights are brutal and destructive, leading to consequences, not only for the story, but the characters. Now these consequences are slightly mitigated by various in-story elements, but that still doesn't take away their impact, due to the intrinsic nature of said consequences. The way it explores the psychological impact on, and issues of, the main, adolescent cast. That’s by far one of the show’s greatest merits, with a fair amount of the episodes being about dealing with some struggle, either extrinsic, intrinsic, or both that they’re going through. Finally, both the background, and foreground details to the story are very well explained. Stuff like the reason the children are in the digital world, or why they were the ones chosen to go to it in the first place. It’s in that way that the show manages to create a tangible environment, establishing a sense of internal reasoning, and therefore giving the story a lot of integrity and realness. Unfortunately, despite Digimon Adventure’s many virtues, even it is not without shortcomings. Grounded and significant as most of the battles are, they’re also very anticlimactic, frequently ending in one attack, thus undercutting the established and built on tension. Additionally, some of the human drama that transpires is rather questionable. While the angle is somewhat understandable, one has to question the show’s internal logic on it. Like in the aforementioned episode where Tai comes back from the real world. Once he returns, he finds out that the team disbanded in his absence and the members all went their separate ways. Now while the idea of Tai being the glue that holds the group together makes sense, it’s odd that the others would split apart, considering that by that point it’d been drilled into their heads that all their successes were because of their unity. Not only that, but it doesn't make much sense how during the separation period, the rest of the children were being tricked by an obviously evil digimon into remaining separated and mistrustinging of each other. Not to mention why they’d even trust anything that comes out of its mouth in the first place, when the digimon in question has the word devil in its name. Aside from these few issues though, Digimon Adventure has a very solid story. Characters: 7/10 The main cast are all introduced as rather cookie-cutter archetypes, and don’t really grow beyond that over the course of the series. Tai’s the hot-headed leader, Matt’s the broody loner, Mimi’s the pure hearted brat, Joe’s the resident buzz killington voice of reason, T.K.’s the token kid, Kari’s the ray of sunshine and Izzy’s the computer wiz that just doesn’t really seem to be able to get emotions. They’re essentially a Power Rangers or Super Sentai team. However, despite how basic their personalities are, those personalities are justified fairly well through their backstories, giving them a sense of humanity past the played out nature of their exteriors. On top of that, the amount of character growth they undergo is amazing, standard as it is, more than making up for their creatively lacking personalities. Finally, the way the characters influence each other’s growth is a sight to behold. An exemplary moment of this is in one episode where Joe selflessly puts himself in harm’s way to save Matt and his little brother. Mind you, this is despite the fact that just before, Matt and Joe went so far as to spit at each other. It’s this very act of selflessness that acting as a catalyst for Joe’s growth, leading him to begin coming out of his shell and teaching him the value of friendship and camaraderie. And it’s moments like these that really showcase one of the show’s strongest points, as well as its capacity for having a heart. Now those who’ve seen the show or have gone through the cast list may have noticed an absent character from the prior listing. This is of course Sora, a character that really exemplifies Digimon Adventure’s character writing capacity, and one that deserves being talked about in more detail. That being said, Sora’s the big sister of the group. She’s very upbeat and supportive, despite being something of a tomboy. But as the series progresses, she grows to be more nurturing, despite not really understanding what that entails. As such, she’s constantly grappling with the idea of tough love, the love one gives another when it’s what they need, even if not what they want, or what may seem the prettiest. This detail of her character interestingly echoes her relationship with her mother. As a result, her growth as a person feels all the more tangible and real when it gets to be reflected not only externally, in her relationship with the group, but also internally, with the reconciliation of a long-withstanding familial matter that’s intrinsic to her being. The digimon partners personality wise are essentially watered down versions of their partners. There are as few traits they have that contradict this idea, which completely oppose those of they partners, but generally the prior statement holds true. One of the standout examples of this is Joe’s digimon partner, that’s more chill than Joe shows enough individuality to basically tell Joe to calm down and not get unnecessarily worked up. In ways such as this the digimon partners get the both have synergy with their partners, due to their similarities, but also function as their counter-balance, making for some nice chemistry. Now the villains have a lot more of a presence. While they’re not that deep or thought provoking as characters, given that their motivation for acting is simply because they want too, what they represent is really intriguing. Each is twisted version of humanity in design and actions, that tries to take over the anarchic digital world and bringing order to it. Even more interestingly though, there’s one exception to this. That of course is the final villain, that takes this idea a fascinating, yet tragic degree further. Art:7/10 The art and animation are pretty good. Despite being made in the 9Os, they manage to not only look good for that time period, but even hold up till the present today. The show just has this timeless intensely visually cartoony atmosphere and style to it, partially due to its use of both very bright, and dim colors for the color scheme. This sense of style is perhaps most expressed through the character designs, which both look cool and give off the 90s Saturday morning cartoon feel that’s just right for this kind of story. Also surprisingly, despite including the dreaded abomination that is CGI, the show manages to make very good use of it in the scenes that include it. Finally, the digimon themselves look very cool, ranging from odd to badass looking. Sound: 6/10 The original soundtrack is pretty good overall. The OST by Takanori Arisawa of Sailor Moon fame is fine for the most part, but where the show’s soundtrack really shines is in the opening themes. Not only does it have some excellent J-pop openings, but a corresponding English version that easily manages to successfully stand beside them. Although that may just be because I grew up with the show. The dub & sub are both fairly good. Having said that, I prefer the dub over the sub for nostalgic reasons, despite the fact it cuts some of the more serious parts of the show. So thank you Fox Kids. Needless to say, it’s recommended that you go for the sub if you want to see the slightly more serious original version. Enjoyment: 8/10 So, suffice to say, I quite liked Digimon Adventure. It has cool characters, adventure, big monster fights, and a very interesting world. It was also one of the first anime I watched as a kid, so that certainly helps. As such, I still love it to this day, and it will always be one of my all time favorites. That said, even though my time with it as an adolescent has passed, I plan on showing it to my younger brother when he’s a little older, possibly even to my kids, in the unlikely scenario I ever have any. Overall: 7/10 If you want to take a trip to the past and relive some happy childhood memories, then look no further than Digimon Adventure(unless you’re a hardcore Pokemon purist). On the other hand, if you don’t have any such memories and are slightly hesitant about watching something that's made for kids, considers looking towards the more mature Digimon Tamers, written by Chiaki J. Konaka, the writer of Serial Experiments Lain, Texhnolyze and Ghost Hound. Special thanks to my editor, Lonecrit.

Shigatsu has taken me to a world of music that I will never forget. Even though the story isn't anything new, the way it was written and directed make it feel like one. It is a story that revolves around music and how it connects people and how it affects them. It does not only affect them in a good way, but in a bad way too. And with that premise, a beautiful story about tennagers started. Although there were some characters that didn't get a proper development to know and understand their own problems, motivations, and dreams, they didn't feel empty and meaningless. They all had a purpose and most of them where helpful to our main characters. They didn't feel cliché neither, even when we got some of them like the childhood friend and the dandy best-friend. And the best part, at least to me, is that there was no fan-service. I didn't get to see a flaw in the animation in the 22 episodes aired. The palette of colours used, especially the blue ones, were gorgeous, while the performance moments were dynamic and realistic. Not to mention the opening and ending sequences, which are to date some of my favourites of all time. Add to this a beautiful ost and amazing songs for the openings and endings and you'll feel in heaven. The opening songs were upbeat and represented a good tonal contrast to the story, while the ending songs complemented it, especially the second one, which can make you cry (if you were not crying already) after the emotional final episodes. Overall, this anime has been one of the bests I've ever seen. It hooked me since the first teaser, and never let me go until the last episode. It is not a hard story, so everyone can enjoy it as much as I did. With loveable and relatable characters with deep stories, a gorgeous animation and an amazing score, I'm pretty sure that this is one of the best anime from the past few years, and the best (TO ME) of this season.

Sorey and friends continue their journey. From what I'm seeing, things can get more serious, and the OP clearly shows that. I will review this as someone who's watched the whole gameplay of the game, since I am clearly too poor to afford it. Fitting 80+ hours of gameplay can prove to be difficult in 24 episodes. But I do like how Ufotable is handling the adaption so far. They keep the key points from the game and they don't tend to rush everything. They do it in a pace that is fairly satisfactory. Story (8) The story continues as they adventure and travel across the land. They might get stronger so that they can have a chance to beat the Lord of Calamity once and for all. I'm interested on where they'll take the story from here. Character (7) We get to see more of Sorey getting stronger to try and fight Malevolence so that he may gain strength to fight the LOC (Lord of Calamity). The Seraphim are the same, with the same personality. Edna, of course, still being my favourite out of all the seraphim. However, we do get to see more of Dezel and how he stuck with Rose almost his whole life. He admires her, and will not hesitate to kill, if it is for the sake of Rose. Speaking of Rose, we get to see a bit more about her. About her past and the revenge she wanted because of what happened to her Fatherly Figure, Brad. Who has died in Rose's past and is now out for revenge for the one who caused all of it. If she hadn't met Sorey, it was probably a possibility that she may fall into Malevolence. Which I wouldn't have wanted. As we dive more into her past we can see why she is quite the badass with those dual knives. She was taken in as a young child due to her parents being either dead or missing, I don't remember. Brad was kind enough to take her in and raise her, and of course train her. Thus forming the Rose we see today. Art (10) I guess there's no surprise there, It is Ufotable after all. Sound (9) The Soundtracks being used for this anime are definitely the right ones. To the OP and ED (imo the OP and ED should've switched, but I'm guessing they're aiming for a different tone for the 2nd cour, which I'm totally ok with btw.) The nice orchestral soundtracks in the background intensifies each moment which adds a nice touch. Enjoyment (8) I did enjoy this as much as Season 1, heck, maybe even more. The action is quite nice and I do like some conversations between the characters. So I'm satisfied with that. Overall (8) This anime continues to be going at a steady pace. I'm glad that Ufotable took the game adaption with care (Although the game itself wasn't very good imo) But hey I'm liking this a bit more than Season 1 because of how the plot gets more interesting and thickens. Some characters are starting to show their true nature, and more problems begin to occur. I wonder how it'll turn out. And with this, Sorey and his gang continues the adventure.

182428,23151,Shounen Hollywood: Holly Stage for 49,"['Music', 'Slice of Life', 'Shoujo']",13059,3875,7810.0,7.0,"With an all male cast, you'd expect the producers to take the usual fan-service route as we watch the bight, glistening lives of these up and coming idols. But Shounen Hollywood gave me a pleasant surprise. First, this show won't please everyone. That's just that. For the same reason not everyone loves a bubbly romance or a quirky comedy, it's all preference and personal taste. Also this is just going to be an informal review focusing on the pros of the series. If you've been watching loads of fast pace, action packed shows and need a little breather, then maybe you might want to give this anime a chance. Shounen Hollywood is a slice of life through and through, and also one of the most realist works I've seen in a long time. The art style itself is more realistic then most anime (but hey different's not bad and it is all still just an art form). It's has a slow, easygoing pace most of the time, and that's where I think this series deserves some credit. It doesn't try to entertain it's audience with tones of drama, traumatic back stories, or shinning comebacks. Rather we see these teenagers as they struggle with their personal problems, insecurities, how they deal with each other, and how they ultimately grow together to make Shounen Hollywood (their group) a success. Anyone familiar with the world of music would know that it takes A LOT of time and work if you want to make a name for yourself. And I like how Shounen Hollywood takes it's time, using a good majority of it portraying how they're just practicing to improve nonstop. Cause the reality is, your not going to get those fans unless you put your best efforts out there. A last point worth mentioning is how fun this is to watch if you are a J-pop fan. Btw, I said this show was realistic but there's probably some people who would beg to differ. And I want to clarify that this show is realistic from a more Japanese perspective. Just different cultures, different values, different norms, you probably get it. So anyways back to my point. The Japanese idol industry is quite different then western pop music, and it was great to see it from a behind-the-scenes sort of way. There were several moments when I saw how several of my favorite guy groups had done or said the exact same things as these characters. And I laughed when realizing, like the Shounen Hollywood members, they probably get embarrassed having to say cliche catch phrases and pickup lines too. The songs themselves remind me of the J-idol style of music. Despite what I've said about it, Shounen Hollywood does have times it could have been better. I truthfully enjoyed it but after all is said and done, I really can't say it was an extraordinary show. Other reviews say plenty on what kind of flaws it has so I won't. But since none of them highlighted what Shounen Hollywood did do right, I though I'd be the one to at least mention them.

This movie was different. The story was complex, the context was very creative, the characters had a lot of depth and the tension throughout felt real, even though we obviously know from the start that it has to end well. The tension was particularly interesting though, given that the movie already revealed the villain quite early (as opposed to most Conan stories) and focussed much more on how the case was solved, which is unusual. And it obviously wasn't just a regular case. Putting the characters in a video game setting obviously allowed for many surprises, twists and turns and the introduction of Sherlock-Holmes-elements made it even more interesting. Furthermore, the video game scenario allowed for much more dramatic life-or-death drama (within the game) than regular Conan stories, because, well, it's ""only"" fictional.

273183,9279,Bara no Hana to Joe,"['Kids', 'Drama']",619,10527,9267.0,7.0,"Hence there's no review for this short, obscure movie I've decided to write one myself, perhaps this might help other users decide whether or not to watch it themselves. This is a fairly old film from the 70's produced by Sanrio, the same staff responsible for the much more acclaimed Chirin no Suzu , so is Bara no Hana to Joe as good as the aforementioned movie? I would have to answer: close enough. First of all, the duration of Bara no Hana to Joe is less than half of Chirin no Suzu, yet in about 20 minutes, it manages to convey a rather unique and bittersweet tale involving Joe, a dog that falls in love with a rose and his dedication into keeping the delicate flower out of the harm's way. The scenario unfolds in an outlandish manner with playful, colorful imagery and is accompanied by groovy jazz audio. It is animated in a simplistic fashion resembling a cartoon, but has some artsy traits here and there to set it apart; everything seems to be manually painted and is a smooth job at that. There's not much to be said about the characters, aside of Joe who is an endearing little pup that tries his biggie best to protect the rose from any perils, the rose is personified a bit as well , but nothing too distinctive aside of showing gratitude towards Joe. Overall, even if Bara no Hana to Joe doesn't explore themes near as consacrated and jarring as Chirin no Suzu, it still manages to convey a lot of emotion in a lighthearted manner and makes for a nice, quick watch and I consider that it deserves at least a bit more recognition for its authenticity.

As someone who started with ONE's webcomic, and moved to Murata's redrawn version, I was hoping this series would get an anime someday, and my prayers have been answered. Having caught up with both mangas, I will judge the anime as an adaptation of said mangas. (mostly) Story: 4 It's hard to rate the story of One Punch Man because the series doesn't really have one. It's episodic in nature, while having a single premise which is character based (Saitama being strong and trying to deal with it). Art: 9 The anime does the redrawn version justice. Everything looks sharp, the direction of the fight scenes is just right, everything is smooth and looks beautiful. Effort was obviously put in this series and it shows. I wish fights were this awesome everywhere. Sound: 9 The soundtrack is simply awesome. I had no idea what kind of soundtrack would fit the series, but its current OST fits the anime so well, I can't imagine any other OST working better for the anime even if I tried. Characters: 9 The characters are typical tropes (some pushed to the extreme), which means they aren't overly deep. That being said, they don't have to be. None of them are unlikable, all of them are epic in their own way, and they work well within the series, so it's a success. Overall: 9 This is a pretty awesome anime, doing both Murata's as well as ONE's versions justice in delivering the shock value, the epicness, as well as the funny moments of the author(s). It's a flawless adaptation of the original material. -Now a comment on the series in general: People who didn't like the series bring up some valid points, not gonna argue with that, but that doesn't mean the series isn't enjoyable -far from it. I honestly believe that people who didn't like the series simply have different taste. There's nothing wrong with the series itself because it truly delivers on the things it sets out to do. My recommendation for the series in general is -whatever reviews or rants you read about here- try it for yourself and see if you like it, because it's very different from your typical shounen. There's humour, trolling, as well as epicness to be had. The only real question is: Is it your cup of tea? Try it and see for yourself.

At first i was skeptical about it, but still gave it a try due to the ratings that the manga had. And if i may say so, i wasn't let down the least. The mixture of action, comedy, supernatural and maybe a little drop of romance makes up a delicious meal. The story begins with Oga being chosen as the parent of the demon king's son, Beelzebub IV. Oga who sees Beel-bo as nothing more than a nuisance tries to get rid of him and in the process beats up some of the strongest delinquents in the school that he is attending, Ishiyama. Although it might not look like it at sometimes, the bond between Oga and Beel-bo is growing and getting stronger. As seen when Oga refuses to give Beel-bo to a group of robbers when they say that they are just going to use him. The Art and Sound go well together and the seiyuu's were perfectly chosen. As for the art itself, it is what i'd call your average style. something that we have all seen once or more. And then we arrive at the characters, alot of typical characters but some with a little twist to them. The real surprise is the main character Oga, he doesn't look like your average shounen ""i need to protect"" character. Oga looks evil in any situation even if he tries to be nice. but that is just physically, Oga is portrayed as ruthless but as said many times he is not the ruthless defiant who doesn't care about his fellow man. In times it is shown that he helps others even if it might mean trouble for him. As seen when he kicked a police officer in his nuts and threw him into the garbage can to prevent Kunieda Aoi from slapping him. A 10, yes i gave a 10 for enjoyment. Why? Since it never ceases to make me laugh and look epic at the same time. Whenever it is out on Sunday morning (for me) i usually watch it even before One Piece. Overall: 8, because the story is not really that deep yet, so the first 7 episodes are given an 8. I cannot know what happens yet since i don't read the manga but i'm pretty sure it'll only get better.

I will not regret those words. Welcome to the Season 3 review of Kaitou Joker. HOW IS MY QUEEN? AS CUTE AS EVER !!!! What about the story? Professor Clover is over, but the battle is just beginning. We are introduced to a new evil, the organization Devil's Fang headed by President D. There is something different about this new evil. Joker finally has his own archenemy! In Season 1 and 2, Professor Clover hated Silver Heart mainly. I remember Professor Clover as like the devil himself, bringing evil and terror. The new evil , President D. hates Joker mainly, we'll find out why in Season 4. He's a sadist that wants to destroy Joker and his Kaitou friends Queen and Spade, even placing bounties on them all, I loved seeing that bounty part in the anime XD President D. is dangerous in that he would send assassins to target Joker on his heists and watch him suffer on that big screen monitor while eating that fat juicy steak lol That is a plus since it gives Joker more formidable opponents on his heists. Joker is still trolling hard! He pretends to lose or get trapped, but he actually has a trick. We are also introduced to a new character, Phoenix! Like President D. we don't find out more who he is until much later, but Phoenix is like the new Shadow Joker. Also it would seem he is not human, he could transform into a cool firebird with wings and powers. Since many heists involve treasures of Phoenix's background, he too competes in the hunt as a rival to Joker. The anime opening is spot on as always and it looks excellent! We got a exciting remix of the Sai Sai Hai Hai in the Season 1/2 Opening, Can't stop listening to this too. The voice-acting of the characters is beautifully done.

It's a classic case of good idea badly executed. First thing I noticed is the sloppy art. In the manga the boys are beautifully drawn; in the anime, the artists seem to run out of steam by the time they finish drawing Kyohei and Takenaga - Ranmaru often ends up looking like a drag queen and Yuki grotesquely cute. The backgrounds are so simplified they are almost nonexistent and the constant use of chibis is distracting and annoying after a while. The characters we get to know fully are only Kyohei and Sunako, we get flashbacks of their earlier years and how they became who they are. The story does not follow the manga copiously, which in itself takes away nothing from the anime, if anything, it makes it new and surprising for the manga fan like me. However, I was almost taken aback by the &quot;perverse&quot; scenes - this is, after all, a story about boys so beautiful that no girl can help but throw herself at them - but while they were more suggestive and just hinted at in the manga, here, they are on vulgar display. One scene comes to mind, where 3 girls rub themselves on a mannequin thinking that it belongs to Kyohei. Although scenes like this one aren't many, it still left me with bad taste in my mouth. Despite its shortcomings, I did enjoy this series somewhat (maybe through sheer will power?). I suspect that if I hadn't been exposed to the manga first, my final score would have been higher. As it stands, I can only give it a 6.

First of all i must say that i really loved the original series, the characters, plot and all. I got emotionally attached to the characters, was feeling happy when they were happy and was pretty sad when they were sad. The specials series consist of 10 episodes each 2 min long. During that time Mei reflects on something that's going on in the main series or tells a short side story about her childhood. And there's always her cat Marshmallow who listens to the stories and comments them. If you expect this specials to be humorous, you'll be disappointed. Almost none of the stories were funny, niether were Marshmallow's comments on them. Marshmallow sees Yamato as a rival so most of his comments are about how he dislikes him. The art is very very simple as well. The only thing i loved about those specials is Marshmallow's seiyuu - Sakurai Takahiro (who was voicing Yamato as well). Usually you expect specials to be a nice/funny/touching/whatever supplement to the main series. Even though they really tried to make the specials cute and funny, the series didn't turn out this way. I was pretty disappointed because the main series were really well made and sometimes were so hilarious i couldn't stop laughing, so i expected the specials to be on the same level. I even wondered if there are the same director and screenwriter as in the main series. It's just hard to understand why specials turned out to be so boring and tasteless.

222594,28623,Koutetsujou no Kabaneri,"['Action', 'Horror', 'Supernatural', 'Drama', 'Fantasy']",480530,145,2586.0,3.0,"Remember the last time an anime truly gripped you, a show that you couldn't put down and was complex and intellectual? If you're looking for something like that, Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress is not the anime for you. Plagued by vanilla characters and repetitious fight scenes, Kabaneri was the disappointment of the season for me. How could something combining zombies, samurai and steam punk be bad? Please allow me to explain ... Long, long ago in a galaxy far, far away there exists a populace chronically threatened by incessant hordes of zombies called Kabane. Most of the world's people are confined to living in tight settlements or aboard one of several titanic locomotives. Although the Attack on Titan comparisons are evident, I initially found the setting reminiscent of the recent cult classic film, Snowpiercer (those of you film buffs who have seen it will probably understand where I'm coming from). All we as viewers seem to need to care about is that the zombies attack by the shitload, are very hard to kill and pretty much everybody is a pussy about it. Ikoma enters stage left with the hatred and knowledge of these creatures that seems to transcend virtually anyone else in the show, despite the fact that he's probably only a teenager. Why? Because anime says so. I was initially receptive of Ikoma's zealous personality, and thought he was a protagonist I could really get behind. He had just cause and didn't whine like a baby. Nowadays that's just about all I need to not hate a character. The first episode was rather intense, and I could feel my expectations building. I kept thinking ""if the show just keeps it up, if it keeps up this intensity it'll be good"". However, the main area where Kabaneri fails is depth. It doesn't have much going for it past its shock and awe face value, and it started to bore me after a few episodes. It's like a young puppy let loose after being in its crate all day. At first it runs around hyperactively and makes lots of noises but eventually ends up just chasing its tail and pooping on the carpet once it loses its excitement. We see Ikoma turn into a Kabaneri, or half man/half Kabane, by a process which is lazily explained. He uses this newfound power to defeat more Kabane, meets this wild child who is also a Kabaneri, develops awkward feelings for her, then the bad guy is introduced, everyone is irritated/mesmerized by him, more Kabane are killed, some people die... yadda, yadda, yadda. I think this script may have actually been stolen from a B movie director and pawned off as an anime. Kabaneri literally has nothing else going for it other then impressive fight scenes and questionable lolli fan service with Mumei. The writing in Kabaneri is just dreadful. I'm not asking for a Pulitzer Prize winning script here, but I would like something better than what can be comprised by a third grader with writer's block. The dialogue is stale and unsettling with constantly recycled lines and sporadic conversations that don't necessarily seem to fit. Mumei is the most frequent culprit here. One minute she's laughing and joking around with little kids and the next she's a cutthroat lapdog unwilling to listen to reason. I get the whole half Kabane thing, but is there also mind control going on? If so, that certainly wasn't explained properly. It's also quite amusing how the Kabane horde attacks are written in the script, as if to say ""oh yeah, in case you forgot, here comes another zombie attack!"" Timing is impeccable. Most of the scenes seem reactionary, like nothing in the show is premeditated. So many different themes or touched on but never really explored. The writers spent too much time delivering cheap action sequences rather than focusing on the characters or what made the Kabane tick. With the zombie genre, Kabaneri had a unique opportunity to do something most anime don't have the luxury of, being scary. While some of the moments were intense, it never really captured the fear that SnK did. I felt rather apathetic when characters were killed off, because the poor writing didn't really make me care. The individuals killed felt more like useless fodder than real people with families and friends that cared about them. I think back to other zombie films like 28 days later and World War Z where I was absolutely frightened during some scenes, wishing that one day an anime is able to capture that same emotion in me. Sometimes, even by anime standards, some events that transpired in Kabaneri can be unreasonable and unrealistic. The fact that I'm questioning the validity in Ikoma's process in becoming a Kabaneri in the first episode speaks volumes. If what he did was truly possible, I feel like it wouldn't be such a revelation and that somebody would've figured it out long before he did considering the Kabane have been around for a while. There's also a portion in episode six or seven (I can't remember which) where a precarious, intense battle where many lives were lost jaggedly transitions to some kind of a festival? How can they sit around making fireworks when they can't even establish rice fields? Are they so naïve to think that fireworks arent going to attract a horde of zombies? Possibly the dumbest scene in the entire anime. If there was anything well-placed in this series, it was Mumei's skirt, since I wasn't unnecessarily bombarded with panty shots while she was flipping through the air in damn near every episode. I could write a lengthy dissertation on all of the issues I had with Kabaneri and its script, but I should probably point out a couple positives for good measure. If there's one upside to the writing that I can attribute, it is undoubtably the fight scenes. For the most part, the scenes are well choreographed and intense with characters introducing new weapons and tactics at various points throughout the show. I also like how they wrote scenes with Ikoma, with incorporating his severe lack of battle experience into his fighting style. He'd be rumbling and bumbling while slightly skiddish, and I often thought he would get overrun by the Kabane... Only to prevail at the last possible moment. This is one of the few areas that I wouldnt improve on. To elaborate on the character aspect, let's start with our protagonist, Ikoma. If anime has taught me anything, it's that the list of badass characters with glasses is rather small (Sakamoto, Shiro etc.). I should've heeded to that red flag when Ikoma was introduced, because underneath it all he really doesn't get that much development. Aside from the first episode or two he serves more as a placeholder in the generic protagonist trope than anything else. The writers were negligent on his past and focused on other aspects of the story instead. Mumei serves as the necessary fan service part of the series, as I've already seen some rather scantily clad images of her floating around the Internet. It's actually kind of sick considering the fact that I think she's only like 13 or 14 in the show. At least we learn a little bit about her past, and how she turned into a Kabaneri to begin with. She arguably has the most depth of any character in the show, as she experiences multiple flashbacks along the way. The villain seems like a spoiled brat who resents his father and wants to bring down everyone else because of it. I don't know if it's just me, but I'm so sick of these archetypes. I mean we get it, your dad was mean to you but can you stop whining about it already? I feel like killing thousands of innocent people to get your point across isn't necessarily the way to get back to your father. The rest of the cast is as bland as they come, all replaceable in their own right. Being the nerd that I am, I really wanted to delve in deeper and see what I was missing in the character's motives and aspirations since they were never really explained. Unfortunately, there's really no source material for me to gander at, as Kabaneri is a standalone anime and not transposed from a manga. Even though I've already watched 12 episodes, I still can't decide if I like the art in this series or not. On one hand, the character models are unique and the environments remind me of an early 2000's anime. But also in some respects I can see that as a negative. It could be used as an excuse for lazy artistry since it didn't have a lavish budget or use the standard illustrations we're used to seeing in anime today. I'll have to go ahead and give the artists the benefit of the doubt on this one, since most steam punk animes seem to have different styles (Last Exile, etc.), and given the fact that there was no overuse of CG. The opening for Kabaneri is actually quite enjoyable. I've seen more and more anime utilizing a small intro phrase or something of that nature to get their opening started, and it really seemed to be effective here. The music seems to fit the setting well, and the animation and choreography was top notch. This is what truly got me hyped for the anime initially. Perhaps even more polarizing than the opening was the ending. Despite the overall disappointment I have for the show, I have since added the ending song to my playlist of top anime music. Some of the rest of the background music fits in decently, but the show still suffers from recycled tracks and occasionally missplaced music. Incorporating a ballad with strong female vocals is normally nice, but not in the middle of a fight scene were Kabane hearts are being ripped out. I don't really know what they were thinking here. The voice acting cast was buffed up, and even ironically included the likes of Yuki Kaji (Eren from SnK), but no single performance really stuck out to me. Not to mention one of the engineers randomly spoke English from time to time. Really, what the hell was that about? Whenever I look back to Kabaneri, I will always think about what could have been. While Attack on Titan was certainly not my favorite anime of all time, Kabaneri had an opportunity to learn from its shortcomings, but it just didn't capitalize. You know what they say, you can lead a horse to water but not make him drink it. If I could recommend this anime to anyone, it would be those who play videogames where they like to mash a button repeatedly (i.e. Dynasty Warriors). There's not much else to be explored then mindless drivel and flashy fight scenes. Eventually someone in anime will get this zombie thing right, but until that day I await with bated breath.

Touma is a student in the Esper Development Program, with very unique skill, the ability to negate supernatural powers, like the ones manifested by other Espers. This, of course, nullifies his good fortune as well: vending machines devour his yen, his cellphone crushed into silicon fragments by his foot, and he has to attend extra classes during the summer. But fate isn't done with Touma, ready to twist the string of his destiny around it's cold slender fingers. Enter Index, hanging to dry from Touma's balcony, a church sister being hunted by... magicians. The plot has an interesting hook, the conflict between science and magic. The first four episodes prove to be interesting, serving as a prelude to what would be a plot line epic in proportions. But Toaru Majutsu no Index [no Index] quickly shifts gears, abandoning an expansive story, for smaller three to four episode arcs surrounding the various characters. It's amusing but for the most part leaves you asking: Why does this matter?. Though the last episode does give some hope, hinting at a conflict between science and magic, that's about to build, brim and explode. The characters are likable, if somewhat cliched. Touma is the can-do hero that attempts to save 'everyone'. Misaka is a shining star in somewhat average cast. Her love/hate relationships with both the lead and her friend Kuroko coupled with her superiority complex is amusing. One of the plots faults is the harem that is accidentally formed. Harems cause symptoms of shallow character interaction and plots driven by mindless love polygons. Shades of these indicators are found in no Index, but hopefully the 'harem factor' won’t be a crutch for the plot in the future. Production The animation and the art is excellent. The palette is bright and vibrant, painting Academy City alive. Cool silvers and grays are layered on the natural colors woven in between the streets. Action scenes are fluid and are filled with some intense scenes on this backdrop. Character models are drawn well, the magician's being the most interesting of the bunch. Kiori and Stiyl seem otherworldly in their outlandish clothing. There were irritating bits of fanservice unappealing because the heroines, for the most part, were flat chested. The music was engaging, a techno flare that fit the whole scientific motif. Neither opening was exceptional, their upbeat chords danced about, setting the appropriate mood. The voice acting wasn't noteworthy, though some of the voices became grating. Index's voice had an annoying timbre that scratched at the senses. Watchability and Enjoyment The structure of the show made my enjoyment of the program, mixed. Some of the chapters were splendid, balancing humor, drama, and action while others made me want to drop the program all together. I have hope for the second season, which promises a return to the whole conflict between magic and science, which intrigued me in the first few episodes. Closing Thoughts The ambition of the plot quickly disappears and what remains is a cast of likable characters, great art, and a promise. Hopefully Toaru Majutsu no Index will deliver on that promise. The small gems of story telling give me confidence that there is still hope for the exploration of the main theme presented. We can only hope.

254563,199,Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi,"['Adventure', 'Supernatural', 'Drama']",913212,40,20.0,10.0,"Story & Writing: Spirited Away exhibits the surreal power to transport the viewer into a dreamlike stupor, to yank them into a fairy tale world where age is an afterthought and logic is trite. The only thing that really matters is the childlike wonder and excitement that envelops anyone who sets foot into Spirited Away's world. The last Miyazaki movie I've seen do this was Howl's Moving Castle, but there is no comparing the magical power of Howl to Spirited Away; the latter spectacularly trumps the former. Spirited Away's story is nothing complex nor guttural; it's very simple but in the best of ways and for the best of reasons. After all, how can you feel like a kid again if the adventure you're following is as convoluted as Star Wars? The story is just the straight main path. It's the detours you take and acquaintances you meet along the way that adds color to your world. And fucked if Spirited Away is short on detours and sights to see. The writing, as always for a Miyazaki film, is multi-layered and packed with detail. A child will understand 60% and still enjoy it, but an actively thinking adult will understand 100% and enjoy it even more. The dialogue may feel compact and simplistic at times, but that's not the only device through which the story is told; the characters' facial expressions, body movements, hand gestures, clothing, etc, etc, each tell a story of their own, and I feel as if only an adult, who has seen their fair share of human expressions and emotions, can truly pick up on the nuances that Spirited Away's myriad of storytelling devices offer. [Spoiler paragraph: My #1 favorite little detail lies at the end of the film: Chihiro's hairband glistens inconspicuously as she turns and look back one last time at the tunnel. This subtle light effect draws attention to her hairband, proving to the viewer that her journey was entirely real, and that maybe her journey will continue to live on and be ""real"" in the viewer's heart until the end of time. End of spoiler paragraph] Art: It's insane to even think that this entire movie is hand drawn and traditionally animated - there is not a lick of CG to be found. The staff's passions and emotions ooze from every single frame of animation and hand-painted background to appear during the movie's 2 hours. Spirited Away is an incredible passion project, and deserves to be called a masterpiece in every respect, rightfully lauded for its impeccable art design, aesthetic, and animation. Sound: The trademark Studio Ghibli orchestrated tracks and piano tracks are all amazing; they fit every scene and underscores emotions like no other.

There's reason to be skeptical of this infant studio that tends to slack of halfway, but they poured a lot into consistantly making Natsume beaut-- I mean, Natsume Yuujinchou beautiful, haha. The softer colour palette and more pencil-like lines compliment the iyashikei feel. And it's hard to not melt a little bit (or, you know, a LOT) at the very gentle and fluid animation every time Natsume smiles. Good to know Shuka knows where to pour the most effort. SOUND/MUSIC - 8 Natsume Yuujinchou uses the same lovely OST every season with only some new tracks, so let's just talk about the OP/ED. Like the OP: makes me excited for more Natsume.

Ah, the ol' too-much-narration to start things off. Things are going to go swell. With an interesting premise, Ryuu no Haisha sadly appears to fall short. I found the world-building aspects surprisingly the most pleasant and enjoyable parts of the film. An issue of ethics and life purpose springs up. However, the film tries too hard to center itself around a deeper meaning and ignores your questions of ""What?"" and ""Wait, why?"" Even doing so, you realize that, after delving in their questions about the human condition, they aren't particularly that deep or thought-provoking either. Although certain noteworthy scenes prove aesthetically appealing, much of the art remains mediocre, and the rest in abusing CGI --the use of which is largely dependent in the latter parts of the film. Such a shame that stunning artistic segments are balanced into mediocrity with the lack of care for...everything else. Minus the soundtrack -- most memorable, the opening/ending track. Simply beautifully composed and relaxing to listen to, it emphasized a sense of wonder that really ties the film together.

242462,14813,Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru.,"['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'School']",683483,74,453.0,8.0,"It actually took me two attempts to get through Oregairu, as after the first season it didn’t seem to be much more than an average romcom. I’m very glad I gave it another chance, however, as it was much more enjoyable the second time around and the second season blows the first out of the water. There are few productions that manage to achieve characterisation as complex as Oregairu, so if you’re after a character-driven drama with a hint of comedy and a ridiculous amount of subtext then this show is for you. Hikigaya Hachiman is an outcast in just about every meaning of the word. By his own admission he hasn’t even talked to a girl in years and can count the number of friends he holds dear without any hands at all. His every waking moment would be a struggle, if he actually cared about what anyone else thought. His impressively cynical attitude ends up getting him forced into the newly formed Service Club by a worried teacher, with the only other member being the similarly isolated Yukinoshita Yukino. Naturally, the two can’t stand each other, but as they work together to help others as part of their club duties they find opinions and attitudes of rubbing off on them and, along with the bubbly but conflicted Yuigahama Yui, desperately fight to navigate the complexities of normal high school life That summary…doesn’t really capture what Oregairu is, but it’ll have to do for now. What begins as an average romantic comedy goes on to become Interpersonal Relationships: The Anime, and does so with style, though the show also has an agenda that it pushes relentlessly (which I’ll get into later). Each character is repeatedly shown to have more and more layers of personality to be explored, meaning that even those who appear to follow simple archetypes can’t be taken at first glance. The drama and emotion are poignant throughout the second season with some refreshing and effective comedy scattered here and there, while the first season merely serves to set the foundation for what the series aims to achieve. Overall, however, the balance between tension and light-hearted everyday living is handled beautifully. It’s worth noting that an entirely different studio took responsibility for the show half way, which may explain some of the difference in quality. Remember that agenda I mentioned earlier? The author’s thoughts on what social strategies constitute an acceptable and effective way of pursuing individual and interpersonal growth fuel the majority of plot developments and to be honest I found that a little disconcerting. It gets to the point where multiple characters appear to connect to some intangible hive-mind to all receive the exact same opinion of any particular event when I feel that in a real situation differing views would play a greater role. That said, however, even when I disagreed with any particular sentiment the anime sought to convey I still enjoyed the story as a whole and I’m sure that many viewers would eat all that subtext with a great big grin. Though if it rubs you the wrong way more than it did me you may be in for an uncomfortable ride. Visually Oregairu is generally very pleasant. I found that the second season’s artwork fit the series better and helped the characters come to life that much more, but at the same time some of the animation is horrific (read: every time anyone’s legs have to be shown while walking or running). The BGM also fits well with several enjoyable tracks in the second half. Summary – From the fan craving material to analyse deeply to the individual seeking an entertaining drama, Oregairu succeeds in catering to multiple audiences and has a great deal of fun while it does so, though the second season is much better than the first. For complex character interaction and drama in a high school setting you can’t do much better. At the same time though, whether you find the writing clever or obnoxious will have a major influence on your enjoyment. I personally am happy to recommend Oregairu.

Spoilers ahead of this show takes place directly after Zeta. Story. It is the year Universal Century 0088 the Titans have been defeated and Kamile Bidan mind was lost in the process turning him into a living vegetable because of this the Neo Zeon raise in power and gain control. The Arguma crew land on Shangri where they meet Judau Ashta a teenager who is taking care of his sister by dismantling mobile suit and selling them for scrap for his buddies. As soon as the Neo Zeons attack the Arguma recruits Judau to pilot the latest mobile suit weapon the Double Zeta Gundam. Am just going say it right now the story of ZZ Gundam is hot garbage. I know that your all thinking but the show fixes itself in the second half, the finale was great and it returned Zeta roots. No. ZZ Gundam was always bad and the show did not improve all that much in second half. Before I tear apart the story of ZZ Gundam am going to tell you good about the story of ZZ Gundam What I liked ZZ Gundam story. I actually thought the themes of growing up to be decently handed. It didn't become a preachy piece of shit and the show did a decent job at showcasing this because as much I hate most of the new characters they actually grow up as the show progresses. What I dislike from ZZ Gundam story. Everything else really due to the show being such a horrendous written show in almost every way possible. The first half of ZZ Gundam aka the 2 worst of Gundam content-wise. Many Gundam fans say that Seed Destiny second half is the worst thing from the franchise. I have to play an unpopular opinion on that because ZZ Gundam is easily the second worst thing I have even from the Gundam franchise only losing to Victory Gundam second half. I will get to the show soon because I have a lot of things to say to you. Back on topic. I was aware of ZZ Gundam goofy reputation because I been told by my friends and at first I didn't mind it the show has a different tone compared to Zeta. Then I watched it and now I just want to Bright Slap Tomino for directing this garbage. The comedic tone of ZZ Gundam is absolutely horrendous in every level. Not only it not appropriate for a Gundam show which keeps in mind it takes right after Zeta ended but it actually butchered the writing and pacing of the show. The comedy was cringe-worthy as we see characters and mechas put in retarded solutions like for example one of my favorite Gundam Zeta has was been reduced into a boxer thanks to Juadu. Who thought that was a good idea to write that. As for the episodes, the only episodes that I liked were the ones that featured Ple in it because she was honestly one of the only redeeming things about this shit show. Everything other episodes including episode 1 were horrendous to watch. Some of these episodes are just so horrendous they feel skippable because they are just that bad like the moon moon story arc which was the 2 episode arc which had no point existing. The second half is a bit better but not by much. The writing has slightly improved as the show has more stakes but it didn't fix everything that was wrong with the show. Overall the story of ZZ Gundam is hot garbage. The second half may be a slight improvement but the show cannot fix the travesty that is the first half. 2/10 Characters. Since the story of ZZ Gundam was absolutely horrendous how are the characters? Are they any better? NO! in fact, some of these characters are worse than the story itself. Judau is just a shitty Gundam protagonist. Imagine Kamile Bidan but without the charm and growth of this character. He's an insufferable brat who is an asshole to people including his own sister. For example of his stupidity is where in one episode he aggressively tries to attack Fa after she slaps him for being a dick to his own sister. For whose asking Yes he does grow up in the second half and it he kinda matures as a character. The problem is that we the audience don't feel any sympathy or connection to this character because he was just an insufferable douchbag in the first half. Now I like flawed characters because they actually have time to grow up and change as human beings. Judau is a perfect example to not write a flawed character and because of he just becomes just another one dimensional Saturday morning cartoon character. By the way, you will be seeing these words Saturday Morning Cartoon characters a lot during this selection of this review. Anyway, screw this character let's talk about Juadu's friends. They are all unlikeable, poorly written and they just felt like Saturday morning cartoon characters. Just horrible. Lenia is not a fucking character whatsoever She a plot device that only the plot going not to mention she's a fucking damsel in distress and a nag. How beautiful. Bright Noa. What did they do to you? You went from a proud and valiant leader in 0079 and Zeta and now in ZZ he devolved into a newtype babysitter. He is so less strick when you compare to him to 0079 and Zeta. What a wonderful way to ruin one of the main iconic characters from the franchise Tomino. The only good new character in ZZ is Ple. Unlike almost all of the characters in ZZ which are basically One Dimensional Satudary Morning Cartoons characters Ple actually has a personality and actually left like an actual character despite being a cyber newtype kid. She was honestly the only characters that I enjoyed from start to finish. It's such a shame that Ple is in this piece of shit show instead of Char Counterattack or even the prequel show Zeta. The villains in ZZ are pathetic. Before I start to roast these quotations ""villains"" let's talk about Haman Karn. She still a good character as still a badass and threating villain and she didn't get butchered unlike a lot of the previous characters. However, I question Haman's obsession with Judau. It was a bit out of character for Haman to have an obsession with Juadu an enemy. In the end of the day she still the best character in the whole entire show. I just wish she was in Char Counterattack instead of this shit show. She was clearly too good to be in this show. Now for the new villains. They are all horrendous. The first Saturday morning cartoon villain character list is Mashymre. He is a one-dimensional character, acts like a fool and he only exists to bring the most repetitive gags from the Gundam franchise where he always chivalry for his lady. Next, for the Saturday morning cartoon villain character list is that fat fucker Guzin who is an obnoxious scumbag. That all can say about him. Glemy is also not a good villain and he mostly exists to teach Leina in quotations ""some manners"" and become a pathetic loser around Roux. Least your not a Saturday morning cartoon character which is a blessing. Chara Soon is a horrendous excuse for a villain. she has no concrete personality beyond being an insufferable bitch whenever she on screen. Also, the voice acting form this character. was ear bleeding? The only decent thing I can about this character that she, not a stupid Saturday morning cartoon villain. Other than that she a fucking mess. Overall like with the story the characters are hot garbage. 2/10 Visuals. Visually ZZ Gundam is almost identical to Zeta Gundam. The characters designs still have that 80s charm that I liked and the backgrounds scenery is still good. As for the mecha designs, I thought they were okay. The double Zeta itself looks cool but I feel it draws the line between real robot to super robot. The rest of the mechs range from good, mediocre to uninspiring. Overall the visuals of ZZ is still pretty good for what it is. 7/10 Sound. The music ZZ Gundam is pretty good overall. Most of the songs in Zeta make a return here but there are some new songs that fit the light-hearted tone of the series. Some of my favorite tracks in ZZ Gundam include Arghama, Shangri La, Masshima Cello and Judau in Space (Track). Anime ja nai is a catchy song that fits comedic first half of the series while the second opening theme Silent voice fits the more serious second half of the series. The voicing, for the most part, is pretty good and most of the seiyuus did a good job for voicing each character minus Chara who sounds like dogshit. Overall the soundtrack is still good as ever. The opening and ending themes were good and the voice acting minus Chara was pretty good. 7/10 Final Thoughts. Train-wreck is the best way to describe this series. The first half was full of a lot of comedic garbage that felt like a poorly made Saturday morning cartoons Most of the characters sucked that behaved like Saturday morning cartoons and the show is a poorly written mess. The only good things from ZZ Gundam were the themes, Ple, visuals, and the music. ZZ Gundam is one of the worst Gundam shows that I have the pleasure of watching from start to finish. Is this worst than the Build Fighters Try, Wing and Seed Destiny? Yes because least those shows were fun to laugh at. ZZ Gundam is a fucking failure of a squeal. ZZ Gundam is one of the worst anime squeals I have ever watched in anime. I don't recommend this show to anyone unless you are a big Gundam freak such as myself. Final Score 2/10 Anyway this was Shawn aka KurataLordStage and I will see you guys next time.

The cat is already pretty old unfortunately and it's clear from the start of the anime that he's getting slower and weaker. Melancholic themes, a tiny bit of intense drama, nice voice acting by both the cat and the girl (we can hear the thoughts of the cat even though he doesn't understand exactly what his owner says. This reinforces the connection between them nicely, showing that even without ""speaking"" the same language they have a much deeper, emotional connection).

311440,35790,Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Drama', 'Fantasy']",517005,128,451.0,10.0,"Please note this review is intended to be read by those that have finished watching Tate No Yuusha No Nariagari and while care has been taken to minimise spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned. Based off a popular light novel of the same name Tate No Yuusha no Nariagari which is better known by its English title The Rising of the shield hero is an action, adventure, fantasy and drama genre anime, that gives us the unique opportunity to see what would happen if a human being from the modern world was not just summoned to a fantasy world but also summoned in order to take up the role of one of the world’s heroes and protect it as a once in a lifetime crisis takes place within the world. While Isekai genre anime like this one has long served as the staple of modern-day anime and on the surface, The Rising of the shield hero may look exactly like a standard example of that esteemed genre there are several aspects of it that in my eyes made it noteworthy. One of the main premises of the Isekai genre is of the fact that after being transported from the original world the person that was summoned will usually be given a large role that’s important to the well-being of the world to which they were summoned too with hero’s being the most common types. However, in the case of the Rising of the shield hero instead of using this common aspect of the genre, it instead flips it and makes the main character Naofumi take up the role of an anti-hero instead of being a hero as his fellows have become. This unique flip on roles while adding some much needed creativity within the genre also served to allow us to see the kind of unique interactions that the world’s inhabitants show to those that don’t fit the idea of their image of a hero which when paired with the types of bonds that Naofumi forges with his party members and his many allies within the series served to give a unique perspective on how prejudiced this new world can be. It is these aspects that served to draw me to this series and ensured that it was one that I would watch until the end. The first episode of the series while doing an excellent job in introducing both the setting, the main hero’s as well as the members of the kingdoms royalty also served well to show the kind of actions that can result from those that have both the power and the influence needed to make life difficult for those that have slighted them. While the first episode proved to be a somewhat controversial shock to some I felt that it was an excellent episode as it served to not just forge the foundations of Naofumi’s cynical personality but also help define his overall quest of finding a way to protect the world while trying to get his name cleared in a world that sees him as nothing more than a villain. The overall story for the series takes place in a parallel world that combines the standard fantasy world where swords, magic and fantasy creatures exist with the types of prejudices and royal intrigues among royalty that’s common within the medieval era of the modern world. In this world of swords and magic, humans are not the only races that inhabit the world for they co-exist alongside various races of demi-humans as well but alas this co-existence is anything but peaceful and especially so in the kingdom of Melromarc. In this kingdom that serves as one of the primary settings for the series the king consort aided by his daughter has mandated a series of suppression on the kingdom’s demi-human population and has not just made life within the kingdom hard for them but also ensured that within the kingdom his word and that of his daughter was the law. A fact that swiftly becomes apparent when Naofumi was not just stripped of his title of hero but also labelled as a villain by both the royal family and the general population after a serious accusation by the princess to which despite having no sign of physical proof ensured that he was transformed from that of a righteous hero to that of a villain that had the title the devil shield. However despite being labelled as a villain and being cut off from all the support that the kingdom could provide him Naofumi determined to both prove his innocence and at the same time get his revenge for all the hardship that the royal family has inflicted on him does not let this stop him and despite being treated harshly by others still fights hard to both continue to live within the world and at the same time fight to protect it in his own way. But he will not do so alone for despite his status his grim determination to protect this world and get back at the royal family serves to draw many unique and powerful allies to his side that serves to not only increase his parties combat ability but also allow him to not just learn more about this world but also use it to his advantage in both defending this world from the waves and in getting justice for himself by proving that the accusations from the royal family were nothing more than lies. However in the face of both the increasing power of the waves which serves to bring increasingly powerful foes to the field and the ever malicious plots by the king consort to ruin him Naofumi and his party must not just fight hard on the field but also stay on their toes if they want to protect this world and fulfil the role of being a hero even one that is unacknowledged and unsung by the masses. Naofumi Naofumi portrayed by veteran voice actor Kaito Ishikawa of Rascal Does Not dream of Bunny Girl sempai and Sakurada Reset fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. An otaku and a second-year student from the modern world that was abruptly summoned to a parallel world in the beginning of the series Naofumi on initial appearances is seen to be a positive, intelligent and earnest person by nature that somewhat contradicts the typical image of otaku’s given that he has no fear of interacting with others in society. A quiet person by nature Naofumi is shown to be someone that prefers to be low key and is shown to prefer using diplomacy to settle matters and ensure that everyone is getting along without any trouble. While doing well in showing Naofumi’s preference to use diplomacy to deal with matters this also did well to show how trusting Naofumi was towards both his fellow heroes and to the members of the royal family that he had just met. However, all of this soon changed as a result of both the false accusation that quickly labelled him kingdom-wide as a criminal and his banishment from the circle of heroes that have been summoned to fight the waves. After the change of Naofumi’s status from hero to criminal Naofumi’s personality gradually started to change. While still remaining quiet and earnest Naofumi also notably becomes more aloof and serious in terms of attitude and indeed is willing to use threats against others if they prove to be obstructive of his goals. At the same time largely as a result of the fact that trust in his newfound state is no longer something that can be expected of others Naofumi was shown to develop a somewhat cynical attitude to life and always expecting things to go awry which is shown well in the encounters that he has with the various allies that he meets along the way. However while this aspect when combined with his willingness to use threats on innocents fitted well with the official story that he was a villain it can be seen that was also a blessing of sorts as it allowed him to easily determine the true nature of someone and more often than not expose them before they can cause any damage to him. Despite Naofumi’s cynical nature and his unwillingness to open his heart to others it can be seen that this is largely restricted to outsiders as when interacting with companions that have proved themselves to him it can be seen that he would not only fight hard to protect them but also work hard at not just developing their skills and equipment but also take great care in determining whether is there anything that’s bothering them aspects that show not just Naofumi’s caring nature but also of how considerate and perceptive he is as well. Despite the betrayal of the royal family it can be seen that Naofumi had never forgotten the fact that he was one of the heroes that have been summoned to this world to fight the waves and despite knowing that he would not get official gratitude from the kingdom and nothing but scorn from the heroes he would still work hard at not just protecting people but also encouraging them to fight together with him showing not just his desire to protect the innocents from harm but also do the job that he was summoned to do and thus showing his sense of responsibility not just to the people but to the world as well. This is perhaps best shown in the defence of Lute village which despite not being evacuated before the wave hit was literally abandoned to its fate by the other heroes due to its negligible strategic worth. Rather than follow suit Naofumi and party instead opted to protect the village and its inhabitants instead of going for the wave’s main force as others would have expected. This victory while a small one in the larger war effort did well in showing that Naofumi’s chief concern was neither glory nor fame but simply the desire to protect innocents that have been caught up in the war. Within the series one of the most important bonds that Naofumi is shown to value the most is the relationship that he has with his fellow party member and confidant Raphtalia. While the relationship between the two was frosty at first due to his initial desire of wanting to use her as a tool this slowly began to change as a result of not just the number of battles and adventures that they have been through together but also of sense of trust that has been formed between the two of them a bond that served to not just ensure that she will not just fight for him but also fight to protect him from the many detractors that exist within the kingdom. As a result, seeing not just the amount of trust that Raphtalia has in him as well as the benefits that can come from having someone that you can rely upon and share burdens with Naofumi’s attitude towards bonds and friendships gradually started to change. While still far from being the first that would make a move when encountering new allies Naofumi gradually begins to learn to show more trust towards not just his allies but also his friends as well and willing to offer genuine praise and support to them when warranted which a far cry to how gruff he was in the past. This aspect is shown well not just in terms of words but also in terms of actions as well in Naofumi’s attempt to both protect his friends from harm by both creating new and better gear for them and in improving in his ability to finish battles quickly and effectively so as to minimise any potential damage to his friends. However, though Naofumi’s attitude towards showing trust in his comrades and to allies that he can trust in was softened the same cannot be said of his attitude towards both the royal family and his fellow cardinal hero’s. More than anything within the series Naofumi is shown to bear nothing but absolute hatred towards both the king consort and Malty who framed him and the cardinal heroes for not questioning the fact that there was no proof of his alleged crime. While this sense of anger towards them serves to not just provide a sense of motivation for Naofumi in his desire to get stronger it also served to provide him a powerful set of skills in the form of the Rage shield that had the potential to increase his combat ability considerably. This power, however, proved to be a double-edged sword however as while giving him a notable increase in combat power it also made him susceptible to the madness within a madness that thankfully he was never able to experience thanks to the increased bonds that connected him with his comrades. The character of Naofumi I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed with the gradual evolution from a typical earnest and positive young man who seemed content with the life that he had to a cynical, serious and grim young man who expected to be betrayed by everyone and then finally to someone who despite living through a betrayal that would have broken a lesser man had not only learned to master the anger within him but also found a new sense of motivation that can not only help himself but his many comrades as well as they fight together to protect the world as hero’s being especially well done. Raphtalia Raphtalia portrayed by veteran seiyuu Asami Seto of Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Sempai and Strike the Blood fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of the series. A member of the Tanuki demi-human race that inhabit the realm Raphtalia on initial appearances is seen to be a quiet, timid and hesitant person by nature. As a result of being enslaved at such a young age, Raphtalia in the beginning was shown to be rather hesitant when dealing with strangers both in terms of standard interaction like going to a restaurant and in learning to use weapons effectively on the field. Despite her fear of not just failing but also displeasing her master she was also shown to get scared easily. However, despite this fear she was shown to be a quick learner when properly motivated showing both determination to help master the new skills that she needs and a strong desire to do her job effectively an aspect that is shown well in the first team-ups between her and Naofumi in the field. At the beginning of the series largely due to her status as a slave Raphtalia was shown to be someone that expected her eventual masters to treat her badly likely due to the images of the number of slaves that she had seen being mistreated during her time at the market. As a result of this, it can be seen that she was pleasantly surprised that while Naofumi was a harsh master at first the efforts that he had put in teaching her not only served to allow her to defend him but also herself as well. At the same time while Naofumi’s outwardly aloof nature made it somewhat hard to approach for her it can be seen that she was surprised that rather than treat her harshly such as feeding her just scraps of food as others would have that Naofumi not only treated her to actual food but also allow her to eat with him as well. As a result of this treatment, it can be seen that Raphtalia’s attitude towards her new master swiftly improved with her fear of her master being largely replaced by a desire to both learn not just new skills but also more about the world to which she lives in. Though the time in which Raphtalia was a slave was a harsh one that had a heavy emotional toll on her it can be said that there was one thing that had kept her from giving in to despair as many of her fellow slaves have had which was her interest in the shield hero that came from the old legends that her parents told her when they were still alive. These legends while essentially nothing more than fabled tales was shown to have a deep impact on her and indeed they served as the primary reason for her desire to serve the shield hero should the opportunity present itself. As a result of this desire, Raphtalia had no qualms about stepping up and make that wish a reality when her master revealed to her his true identity. While very much aware that her skills were not yet powerful enough to be able to protect him effectively Raphtalia vowed to not just become stronger but to be also brave enough to fight by his side as his sword a vow that swiftly becomes a reality. After growing up both mentally and physically and after seeing the kind of treatment that Naofumi receives from the kingdom’s people Raphtalia’s personality gradually starts to change. While still quiet to a degree Raphtalia in her grown-up form was seen to have become much more confident and direct with both her words and actions. While her child form would have shown some hesitation in both the usage of weapons and in identifying herself as part of the shield hero’s party here as a result of her newly founded confidence it can be seen this fear is no longer present and indeed is replaced by a strong sense of loyalty towards her master. This aspect is shown well in the many instances where Raphtalia stepped up to both stand up for herself and her master after being slandered by others. An interesting development that came about as a result of Raphtalia’s newly founded confidence that I found to be quite endearing was the fact that Raphtalia while for the most part was content with following her master’s orders was not above acting forcefully to force her master to take a deeper look at a situation. A good example of this is during the time when Raphtalia reminds Naofumi that there is no need to try and do everything by himself. While Raphtalia’s newly discovered confidence served to not just allow her to better defend her master both on the field and in society it can be said that this newly founded confidence also managed to awaken or otherwise enhance the other personality traits that had existed within Raphtalia. At the beginning of the series while noted to have a keen eye for detail Raphtalia was noted to be somewhat hesitant in passing what she had found to her master and as a result, causing delays in situational processing for the party. In the wake of her newly awakened confidence, however, this sense of hesitation and fear of acting outside of her bounds was replaced by her embracing her excellent senses while at the same time learning to pass on what she had learned to her master quickly and effectively. While enabling her to better support her master on the field this overcoming of her hesitation also allowed her to show more care towards her master by acting as both a comrade and a confidant to which she can provide both advice and her own unique take on the kind of situations that the party encounters in their journeys by listening too and determining the main aspects of the facts that have been discovered by Naofumi even the ones that Naofumi did not want to reveal. While showing well how considerate and understanding Raphtalia had become this also did well in showing the increasing bonds that have been forming between Raphtalia and her master as her past self would never have wished her masters displeasure by pressing for the whole truth. As a result of the ever-increasing bonds that have been forged between them its perhaps unsurprising that Raphtalia views the relationship that she has with her master as something that was dear to her and indeed this bond can be seen to act as her primary sense of motivation in life for in her mind it was the meeting between the two that had allowed her to break out of the grim reality of slavery and given her a new purpose in life which was to act as her masters sword. While serving to ensure that the bond between the two were almost unbreakable on account of the strong debt that both feel that they owe each other this bond when combined with her perceptive nature also allowed Raphtalia to better understand Naofumi’s personality and see past the lies that he creates to both protect himself and his parties while masking his true kind-hearted nature. While certainly understanding the necessity of protecting innocents from being targeted by his detractors it can be seen that Raphtalia dislikes the idea as while hiding the fact that her master had worked so hard to protect innocents it also served to prolong the impression that he was a villain as per the official kingdom’s bio of him a fact that frustrates Raphtalia to no end. As a result of the strong bond that had been formed between Raphtalia and her master its perhaps unsurprising that she will find it threatened when a new party member joins, but such is the reality when Filo joined the party. While the introduction of Filo and later Melty within the party served to create some unique problems for Raphtalia it also served to allow Raphtalia to realise that while the bond that has been forged between her and her master was a strong one that didn’t mean that she cannot learn to expand the bond to accommodate other allies that have proven her worth not just to her but to her master as well. While the relationship between Raphtalia, Melty and Filo was a frosty one at first it can be seen that this gradually began to change and be replaced by a sense of mutual respect that results from the development of both friendships and the acknowledgement of a valued comrade. While doing well in both boosting the amount of combat power that the party can call upon this new bond also served to expand both Raphtalia’s desire to make more friends but at the same time awaken her desire to treat her party members as something akin to family members and protect them with all her might. While doing well in expanding upon her desire to make more friends in this world I felt that this development of hers also did well to introduce a surprisingly motherly side to Raphtalia’s character. The character of Raphtalia I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed. The evolution of her character from a little girl who as a result of being forced into slavery from a young age and who was easily scared, nervous and unwilling to show her true thoughts to one that was not just more confident, intelligent and direct with both her actions and her words was well done. This is especially seen well in the role that Raphtalia had chosen for herself within the party which was that of her master’s sword as in this capacity she is not just able to stay by her master’s side as his sword but also act as his confidant and shield when needed. However this sense of seeing herself as a sword is by no means a way to view herself as a lesser being and indeed the opposite is true for Raphtalia sees the role of being her masters sword as both a means to repay her debt to her master for giving her a new purpose in life and for allowing her to meet the one person that she had wished so fervently to meet and save her from the bleak world that she had lived in. In a way it is perhaps fate that had allowed both Raphtalia and Naofumi to encounter each other for not only had they through their bonds with each other managed to create a bond that was not just able to provide both with a sense of trust, understanding and warmth that both had lost but also for the first time in their lives create a place where both feel that they can belong too and where they can show their true selves to each other while allowing both to stabilise their own fears and insecurities and help them become better people in the long run. Filo Filo portrayed by veteran seiyuu Rina Hidaka of SAO and Boarding School Juliet fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of Naofumi’s combat party. A member of the Filolials race a demi-human race that inhabits the realm Filo on initial appearances is seen to be an excitable, positive and innocent person by nature that closely resembles a child which considering the fact that she had just hatched prior was an apt term. While excitable Filo was also a polite, kind and loyal person by nature that enabled her to easily forge friendships with others as seen in how quickly she befriended Melty. Due largely to her child-like personality Filo was someone that was seen to have a keen sense of curiosity which when combined with her perceptive nature made her surprisingly keen-eyed at times which within the series is used well in her interactions with the spear hero. Unlike the other members of her race however Filo is able to transform into both an bird form and a human form that while showing that she is by no means a normal member of her race also does well in providing the party with some much needed tactical flexibility as her bird form allows her to both provide a means to travel to other locations within the realm faster while at the same time allow her to provide a much-needed boost to the party’s combat ability through the use of her talons. As the series goes on however and Filo’s personality is gradually expanded upon it can be seen that Filo despite being a kind and caring person by nature is shown to be both surprisingly stubborn and at the same time teasing at times with this latter point being used for comical effect with regards to the spear hero. Indeed, this stubbornness of her’s while itself normally a negative trait of hers can be seen here as a defining trait of hers when used in conjunction with both her friendly nature and her loyalty to both her friends and comrades. This is shown well within the series during the rescue of Melty who can be said to be her first friend from the corrupt noble Idol where despite facing fierce resistance from his guards Filo still changed straight into the teeth of his defences to save her. While a powerful combatant that’s almost equal to Raphtalia and a definite asset to the party it can be seen that unlike Raphtalia Filo herself lacked any strong sense of motivation for wanting to serve Naofumi which while lessening the amount of power that she can call upon to help them when the situation requires it also made her susceptible to doubt as well something that Fitoria was able to exploit well within the series. However, despite this flaw, it can be seen that when Filo is properly motivated and has something and someone that she wants to protect that she too is capable of changing her personality in order to compensate for her own flaws. This within the series is shown during the rematch with Fitoria in which Filo rather than charging into battle without a plan as she would have done previously instead opted to show both calmness and caution willing to wait and observe the enemy’s attacks before deciding on how to approach a given battle. At the same time, Filo also awakened within her the one reason that she had needed to motivate her to become stronger which was her desire to both protect her comrades and at the same time her friends Naofumi, Raphtalia and most importantly Melty. The character of Filo I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed with her evolution from a newly hatched girl that while infinitely curious and positive and cheerful to a fault to a girl that was not just immensely loyal to both her friends and comrades but also versatile enough to act as both a fighter and the parties rapid response asset being especially well done. While Filo’s versatility is without a doubt impressive for the party I felt that it was so for us the viewers as well as it allowed her to provide a degree of comic relief in her treatment of the spear hero. Melty Melty portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Maaya Uchida of Charlotte and Goblin Slayer fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Naofumi’s allies within the series. The second princess of the kingdom of Melromarc and the younger sister of the first princess Malty Melty unlike her older sister is a kind, caring and positive person by nature that despite her young age is able to see easily the larger picture of a given situation and react accordingly showing not just her intelligence but also her quick thinking nature as well. Unlike her elder sister and despite her young age Melty is able to project both a sense of gracefulness, calmness and sincerity that few girls her age is able to show and while doing well in showing the kind of behaviour that a princess should act with also does well to show that despite the darkness within the royal family there is still light within it. While a calm and kind person by nature Melty was also someone that was not just open-minded but also perceptive being able to not just accept the circumstances of an event but also pick out the main points of it no matter how far-fetched the story was and who it allegedly involves. This is further supported by her preference to confirm things with her own eyes rather than rely on the eyes of others as royalty often do. Unlike her older sister Melty was someone that was seen to be akin to a people’s princess in that she was not just friendly but also polite as well and was willing to apologize to others directly rather than send others to do so on her behalf and while further cementing her role as a princess also ensured that the impression that she left on others was a good one. True to her sincere and honest nature Melty was someone that preferred to be direct with her words and seemed to prefer to get to the heart of a matter quickly rather than waste time with pleasantries as other royals would have something that I felt complemented her nature really well. Unlike most people within her, kingdom Melty was someone that was curious by nature and was someone that believed that not all monsters were enemies of man which is best shown in the manner of how Melty met Naofumi and party and also in the strong friendship that she forms with Filo later on despite knowing who she was. In line with Melty’s core personality traits of being sincere and honest, it's perhaps unsurprising that Melty is someone that is shown to have an intense dislike of not just injustice but also the act of wanton cruelty that have been perpetrated by both her sister and her father across the kingdom. Indeed, while certainly uncomfortable on hearing the news it can be inferred that Melty must also feel immense regret that someone from her own family was actually responsible for these acts as well. As a result of this and in line with the image that she was the princess that will herald in a new change to the kingdom it was both a breath of fresh air and incredibly satisfying in seeing Melty lay the foundations for her mother’s return to the palace to bring about the change that she so desired. As the series goes on however and Melty gets to experience first-hand not just how life outside the palace is like but also what it's like to travel with people that doesn’t let her status as a princess change in how they interact with her Melty’s personality gradually starts to change. Despite Melty’s image of an people’s princess whose kindness and calm nature was known across the kingdom it can be seen quite surprisingly that despite that Melty is still very much capable of showing anger as well which when combined with the verbal bards that she throws out at those that have angered her had the effect of showing a surprisingly cute side to her character. Unlike the rest of the royals Melty largely as a result of her mother’s teachings is of the belief that while the decision to summon all of the hero’s within one kingdom was the wrong decision believes that instead of simply confronting the waves haphazardly as the heroes had done so until she arrived that they should make the effort to form a unified front and fight the waves together. However this is by no means an easy task as not only had her father and sisters schemes splintered the unity of the hero’s but they had also created an intense sense of distrust between them that was not only making the situation grimmer but also gave other parties the gap that they needed to put forward with their own plans. Due largely to Melty’s role as a princess its perhaps unsurprising that she is someone that while knowing how things would work in theory would have no real knowledge on how things actually work in practice and as a result she while certainly diligent in her studies knew very little of the kind of life that exists outside of the walls of the palace. As a result, she was in for a rude awakening when she not only saw first-hand the kind of crimes that had been committed by the Knights of the kingdom but also of the actions that her esteemed father and sister had committed for no other reason other than just petty pride. This within her created a sense of doubt within her heart that served as her characters primary struggle which pitted her against whether to keep running away from her responsibilities and avoid conflict with her father and sister or to stand and fight and bring change back to the land by getting word to her mother the queen. Despite the difficult choice that effectively pitted her own ideas and desire to see fairness in her kingdom be extended to all with the petty pride that her own father and sister was displaying I was glad that Melty’s experience with Naofumi and his party and her ability to see the larger picture contributed in enabling her to make the right decision and bring back her true ruler of the land and turn the war around. In the beginning of the series Melty’s relationship with Naofumi was shown to be a rather frosty one due to his distrust of members of the royal family as a result of the betrayal that he was subjected to which when combined with Naofumi’s aloof and cold nature only served to make Melty’s job of mending relations between the royal family and him a difficult job. However, as the series progressed and Naofumi was able to not just see first-hand the kind of efforts that Melty was putting in to mend the rift between him and the royals his impression of hers gradually began to soften much to her delight. Though still somewhat put off by his aloof nature and his unwillingness to show his true feelings openly Melty like Raphtalia and Filo before her was able to see past his guard and see the kind and caring person that lay beneath the shield that Naofumi puts up around people and as a result began to treat him as a friend and comrade with the first of her steps being to get her to call her by her first name rather than her role identifier a scene that I felt was both amusing yet heartwarming. While Melty and Naofumi are shown to quarrel quite a bit over the course of their journey rather than showing any sense of anger between the two it can be seen that rather the opposite is true for rather than create splits between the two these quarrels actually serve to allow both Melty and Naofumi to improve the bonds that been formed between them and allow Naofumi to not just understand how things within the kingdom work but also allow him to see things from her perspective as well and contributing in allowing both to eventually see each other as comrades that can be counted upon to help each other when needed. The character of Melty I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed with her evolution from a kind, polite and caring young woman who while acting in good faith knew little of how things worked in the real world to someone who despite seeing the amount of darkness that lurked outside the walls yet was still determined enough to stay true to her ideas and correct the mistakes that have been committed by her father and sister by standing with the one hero who had been shouldering the burden of protecting the people by himself to be well done. While the relationship between Melty and Naofumi was not developed to the same level as the one between Naofumi and Raphtalia I felt that it was still well thought out as Melty’s first responsibility was always going to be the safeguarding of both the country and the people despite her feelings for Naofumi. AMV In term of animation, I thought that the series characters both in terms of main and support ones were not just well designed but also matched well visually with not just their roles within the story but also with the circumstances of said character within it. This is shown especially well with relation to the heroes and their support parties with Naofumi and his party being of particular note. While the Sword, spear and bow hero’s as a result of their acceptance by both the king consort and the princess Malty were both expensively equipped and armed and armoured in the best gear available Naofumi’s party was the opposite with him bearing ragged but yet functional equipment that reflected their contrasting fortunes within the world. Notably, I felt the character designs also made great use of colour to not just show the personalities of the characters but also serve to make them more distinguishable on screen. In this regard, this proved particularly effective for both Raphtalia and Melty both of which bore distinctive designs that matched well with their personalities. In terms of environment design and variety, I felt that the series made great use of the types of locations that can exist within a fantasy world where both magic and monsters can exist. While the series did well in featuring the standard villages, towns, mines, and ruins it also featured a surprising amount of variety by featuring locations like ghost ships, beaches, leisurely islands and more within the series. In terms of combat animation and fights this is one area in which I felt the series truly excelled at thanks to both the many excellently designed enemies and the strong and well designed battles that take advantage of both the enemy design and the ever-increasing bonds between the members of Naofumi’s party that ensured that while their abilities and skills improve in leaps and bounds that they also understand the kind of roles in which they must fulfil when fighting on the front line. While strength certainly is important I felt that the battles in which Naofumi and party fought in also made great use of tactics and strategy which when used in combination with the trust that was formed between the party served to make each battle within the series a unique and entertaining experience. In terms of music the series made use of two opening and ending themes for the two cours with the openings being Rise and Faith by MADKID and three ending themes which were Kimi No Namae by Chiai Fujikawa, Failing Through Starlight by Raphtalia’s seiyuu Asami Seto and Atashi ga Tonari ni Iru Uchi Ni that was also sung by Chiai. Of the opening themes while both Rise and Faith served well to both introduce tension within the series on account of the kind of stakes that the world was facing in the form of the waves also served to introduce differing sub emotions as well with the former introducing both darkness and a desire to take back something that was lost which matched well with the first cour while the second introduced the themes of determination to stand firm with your allies and friends against the waves to protect them in the present to ensure a future ensures. With regards to the ending themes like the opening themes they too also served to represent specific themes within the series with Kimi No Namae being one that symbolised both despair and resentment against the world which I felt matched the first episodes superbly. The latter two ending themes while symbolising the types of emotions that the members of the party were experiencing as they bonded with each other also I felt grew calmer and more peaceful in their undercurrents and reflecting well on the gradually improving situation within the world thanks to Naofumi and party’s efforts on the front. In terms of the series OST, I felt that this was very well designed as it showed a surprisingly an excellent variety that allowed it to switch from calming tones to grand ones seamlessly as the series story progressed. The ones for combat scenes, in particular, were particularly impressive with my personal favourite being the one in ep11. In terms of voice acting, I felt that the series main voice cast did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether main or support ones. In particular, I felt that Kaito Ishikawa, Asami Seto, Rina Hidaka, and Maaya Uchida all did an excellent job at portraying the characters of Naofumi, Raphtalia, Filo, and Melty respectively. Though the two were only introduced in the latter half of the series I felt that veteran seiyuu’s Sakura Tange and Kikuko Inoue both did an excellent job at portraying the characters of Fitoria and Mirelia respectively. Likewise, the characters of L’Arc and Therese who were portrayed by veteran seiyuu’s Jun Fukuyama and Saori Hayami respectively while only appearing near the end of the series proved to be surprisingly effective characters on account of both their chemistry and combat ability. While later comers to the series the vocal ability of both veterans really helped in ensuring that their respective characters left a lasting impact within the series as it neared its end. While only appearing twice within the series I felt that Megumi Han who portrayed the character of Glass did an excellent job at portraying the mysterious and enigmatic beauty whose sharp tongue is on par with both her high combat ability and her enigmatic nature. Overall conclusion In overall Tate No Yuusha No Nariagari was an excellent anime that I felt was one of the best ones of the spring 2019 season with its main strong points being its unique premise that expanded upon the traditional concepts of both the Isekai genre and of Hero led animes, an excellent and well designed story, excellent and well developed characters, strong voice acting from a talented voice cast and well designed and executed battles that combined excellent tension with easily relatable stakes for both the heroes and the world. The overall story of the series is without a doubt one of the series greatest strengths due to its combination of combining both the overall journey that Naofumi and his party went through as they went from being outcasts that were shunned by the kingdoms general populace to becoming hero’s that proudly stood and fought on the frontlines to protect the people from danger and the impact that these actions had on the larger war effort as a result of the many strong and lasting bonds that have been forged not just between Naofumi and his party but also with the many support characters that existed in the kingdom but yet were reluctant to ally with the kingdom for various reasons. While the overall story did start off by making use of a unique concept for Naofumi’s origin story that might have raised a few eyebrows I felt that this concept of introducing the role of a atypical hero to Naofumi’s character actually ended up being a well thought out idea as not only did it ensure that Naofumi was determined to prove his innocence in the eyes of the kingdom but also cause him to realise that as a result of being cut off from the kingdom’s resources that he would have to find a means to increase his combat effectiveness. While the decision to include slavery into the series was a tricky concept that proved controversial in some areas I felt that this method in the end managed to serve its intended purpose well as while it allowed Naofumi to increase his combat ability by taking Raphtalia under his wing this also allowed the opening of his eyes to the concepts of both friendship, bonds and loyalty that would later go to serve both him and the party well as Raphtalia’s inclusion into his party not only allowed him to gain a potent sword that can tear through the toughest of foes but also allow him to gain a close confidant that serves to balance out the cynicism that had developed within him. As the party expanded thanks to Filo and Melty’s introduction this bond of friendship not only served to make the party a much potent force on both the battlefield and in the kingdom but also served to expand the world significantly a fact that I felt was an excellent result. While the role of any hero within a series is to act to protect the people from harm I felt that Naofumi’s role as an atypical hero and the cynical nature that he had surrounded himself with as a result of the betrayal made him somewhat unique. While this nature of his more often than not served to make others suspicious of him I felt that this also made the effects that his actions had on others and the reactions that they give after seeing it that much more powerful while also giving both Naofumi and myself a great degree of satisfaction especially if the said party was the arrogant type. Taking advantage of both the story and the character development that came about was the series excellent combat scenes. While most Isekai series that feature combat tend to follow the standard role of having fighters, rogues, mages and healers I felt that The Rising of the shield hero just as they improved upon the hero concept also served to expand upon the combat as well. While Naofumi himself may have been a fighter the fact that his main weapon was a shield may have given the impression that he was a one tricked pony but within the series this is not the case as thanks to the large variety of shield designs and abilities the shield that many looked down upon can be said to be one of the most powerful weapons within the series thanks to the sheer amount of tactical flexibility that it gives both him and the party. Likewise, this is also shown in both Raphtalia and Filo as well who acts as both the party’s main melee attacker and guerrilla fighter and mage and fast attack fighter respectively. Melty while joining the party only halfway through the first half of the series also served to become a potent force for Naofumi’s party as Melty while a competent mage was also a skilled diplomat whose intelligence and perceptiveness made her a worthwhile addition to the party. These dual roles within the party while the having the potential to cause great damage to any enemy that they fight along the way also had the potential to cause great confusion to them if they were used haphazardly but thankfully within the series these dual roles were used to great effect when used in conjunction with the strong bonds of friendship, loyalty, determination and desire that served to link the core party of Naofumi, Raphtalia, Filo and Melty in a nigh unbreakable bond that served to become their solid foundation as they fought to beat back the waves and protect the kingdom and its people from harm. This within the series is shown especially well within the series many battles in which the cast’s unity and determination allowed the creation and unleashing of many powerful and unique combo’s that while allowing the defeat of many an enemy also showed the depths of the bonds that made it possible. In terms of final score, I can say for certain that Tate No Yuusha No Nariagari easily deserves a final score of 10/10 on account of its combination of a unique take on a tried and tested premise, excellent world building, well designed, developed and easily relatable characters, excellent combat scenes that were paired well with unique and powerful enemies and excellent voice acting from a top tier voice cast.

Frankly , this should've been included with the parent anime from 2017, IMAO this was more like done to boost up the Novel sales, but then again watching this was pretty much ok, especially when we have the Ymada Ef arce where we see Yamada's relationship with her mom as she finally get her own way, but whether or not she kissed Masamune was debatable, thought I'd wish she did. Characterwise nothing has changed since we still see the same character around here, but there were some developments with Yamada elf as she tries to further her relationship with Mansamune and Sagiri as she tries to break her chains of isolation by caring for her onichan. Soundwise , well we did get to know about Yamada Elf's song that was substituted for ""adrenaline!!!"" by TrySail that was played on the 2nd ep of the OVA...Btw as you watch this there will only be one fanservice around here and that's with Yamada Elf, but don't expect it to be a good one , So how I rate this anime is: Story-mediocre 5: The OVA still rides with the parent anime. Art-Mediocre 5: No changes whatsoever, even Yamada's fanservice wasn't that good. Sound- Good 7: For Yamada's song in ep 1. Character- Fair 6: The same character , but there were some developments with Yamada elf's to Masamune and Sagiris coming out of her room kind of thing. Enjoyment- good 7: Since it was still as funny as ever especially when Muramasa tries in vain to see the sick Masamune. Overall- fair 6: Welp it was just very usual for original creator, Fushimi, Tsukasa to focus on sibling relationships like he did with OreImo, so basically for him to make such as this OVA was just him who can't get enough of that BroCon kind of thing, in fact his 13- Banme alice , Neko-sis and Meitantei Shikkaku na Kanojo weren't much of a success.

I reviewed both series about Lelouch's rebellion and was generally pretty positive. This time we're looking at a special that was bundled with the home release, Nunnally in Wonderland. Which obviously has to do with Lewis Carroll's most famous work, Sylvie & Bruno. Story: The narrative is simple enough. Nunnally and Lelouch are sitting together when Nunnally mentions missing hearing him tell stories. So, Lelouch summons the cast of the anime to tell her a variation of Alice in Wonderland with her as the protagonist. Honestly, the biggest problem with the narrative is that it comes across as very low effort. Take a famous, public domain story, abridge the hell out of it, put in some nods to your series and boom. It doesn't help that the story they're using is as over-used as Romeo and Juliet or A Christmas Carol. If they actually had used a lesser known Carroll story, it would have at least felt a bit more unique. For positives, its basically a passable version of the story. And it is hard to get too critical with something that's wholly bonus content. Not that that would stop me if they'd done a really bad job. Characters: What this special gives us in terms of characterisation is brief snippets of each character's personality. A lot of them only show up for around thirty seconds. Which means that their personalities don't really shine nor does it do anything particularly new with anyone. It relies on you already knowing what they're like. Which is a reasonable expectation given that it's bundled with the home release. Art: The art does generally look good. I'm not the biggest fan of the character designs. I still think they're overly thin and stretched but the backgrounds do look good and the Wonderland inspiration does shine through. My issue is that there's virtually no animation to speak of. Most of the special uses still images like it's trying to be a visual novel. This also has, quite possibly, the worst action sequence of all time when Suzaku fights Gino. I know we're not supposed to be taking this seriously but it's not even a funny sequence. Sound: You can't fault the actors. They deliver good performances. The music is nicely composed as well. Ho-yay: This special makes the odd decision of putting Cornelia & Euphemia in married roles. Out of all the possible people, you decided to present sisters as married? I know there's a portion of the fanbase that's into that, but it still seems odd. Areas of Improvement: Put more personality into it. I get that it's a bonus but you could have some effort. Actually animate it. Have fewer characters and longer scenes. I get that you wanted as many Code Geass characters as possible, but you really don't need them all. Final Thoughts: Ultimately, this just feels a bit pointless and lazy. If you really want to see the cast of this series in an abridged version of Wonderland, I guess this is for you. But I've honestly seen so many variations of this story done so much better. For bonus content, it's better than nothing but not very exciting. I'll give it a 5/10.

Think of watching Redline as getting a handjob, the first 12 minutes right until the main titles is the best part of the service, and right when you think you're about to nut, you don't. From then on, it's just a downhill spiral of typical Japanese anime plot and bullshittery. Sure there are bits and parts where you feel it's getting interesting again, but you don't get any coherent form of build up,suspense and climax that's supposed to be present in a good story. It is only great at one aspect and one aspect only - the art. You'd have to be a prepubescent child to fully enjoy this film, the more you try to analyze and try to understand the setting and plot, the more you'll be questioning if they'd even have one. It's as if the writer's department in Madhouse Studio decided to make Katsuhito Ishii (lead writer of Redline) inhale fumes made from marinated cow shit and have him write the story while he was hallucinating. The grand finale especially, I cannot describe how crazy it is without going into more details, but a worse plot would be if a mad scientist made all dogs as intelligent as humans, and so a syndicate of evil rich dogs was formed and they controlled all the world's water supply and enslaved humans. One dog who has developed super powers during the mutation process is the key to saving the human race and turning things back to the way they were. On his journey he met a love interest and he realized that in order to save mankind he would have to risk losing her. In the end he decided to forgo his selfish needs for the salvation of mankind, and so everyone lived happily ever after. Anyway, Redline it started out really strong, but 98% of the enjoyment I had was from the first 12 minutes of the show. My suggestion?

There isn't much story in this OVA, and it has nothing to add to Darker Than BLACK. The animation is fine like the show, The Cherry blossom petals are drawn in nicely. The voice acting for both the subbed and dubbed version are both good, if you already read my review of this show, I have already said enough of it. I already said enough of the music by Yoko Kanno, she has done better musical scores. The characters are also the usual and I already said enough about them as well. I guess the real question is... Is this OVA worth seeing? Yes and No. I say yes if you already enjoyed watching the show before, and I say no because it does not add anything to Darker Than BLACK.

However, after the first episode there was a fair amount of hype for the show, so I decided to join the crowd and give it a watch. To my surprise, Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis was a pleasant experience. But there is one aspect of the show that holds it back; time. The first episode does well to draw the audience in to the world of Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis. The goal of the show is made apparent within the first few scenes; Bahamut, a dangerous dragon-like monster may come back one day to destroy the world. The main characters are then introduced in a well choreographed battle across a medieval town. The visuals and the music of the battle give a strong sense of adventure and fun and primes the audience for what's ahead. Quickly after the introduction of Amira, the story is set as the characters embark on their journey across this interesting world. Sadly though, the journey doesn't last long. Within six episodes the main characters are back at the beginning and the show starts building up to its climax. This, perhaps, stems from the fact that Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis was only given 12 episodes to tell its full story. The beginning of the show gives a feeling similar to Lord of the Rings or Avatar the Last Airbender; the characters are going to explore the world, learning along the way before leading to the climax where everything comes together. However, the show only gives a teaser of its world. This leads to a fairly mediocre conclusion where scenes that should be emotional instead feel forced and lack any weight. The time constraint issues affect the pacing too. Battles go faster than they should, time within the show moves quickly and there are very few scenes that actually allow time for the audience to absorb the gravity of what's going on. This also negatively affects the character and plot development, speeding through scenes to get to the next plot point. Nevertheless, there are plenty of memorable moments along the way to keep the audience entertained. The characters are interesting and their interactions are genuinely delightful to watch. The action is done well enough together with the soundtrack. The comedy mostly hits the mark and doesn't harm the tone of the show. The story doesn't leave any questions unanswered either. In the end, Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis is an anime that I wish had more time given to it. I wanted to know more about the world. I wanted to see the characters go through many different towns and scheme their way through various situations. I wanted more time to grow attached to the characters and understand the gravity of the impending release of Bahamut. Instead, what the anime ended up being was a teaser for what could have been. Still, if people want to give this show a go I would recommend watching it. But, perhaps put other better shows as a higher priority.

9368,437,Perfect Blue,"['Dementia', 'Drama', 'Horror', 'Psychological']",255885,386,164.0,9.0,"Why is it that I always end up watching movies like this at 4 am, in my room, alone? STORY - Perfect Blue is a very loose novel adaptation that was originally intended to be (and eventually made into) a live action movie, and it's very clear that the story presented in the film would have been very fitting for a live action treatment. As one of Satoshi Kon's earliest works, I found it interesting that his trademark themes are so prominent already -- reality and fantasy feel indefinitely blurred, and the audience is left as bewildered as the characters they're witnessing. Mima's acting career puts her in a role that becomes increasingly similar to her real life situation, and the stress of having to perform less-than-desirable roles coupled with a bizarre stalker-like website personality claiming to be her throws her world into chaos. The story itself has a very classic feel to it -- a person's insecurity and doubt after making a major life decision isn't anything groundbreaking, but it's an easy-to-relate to subject, and there are many ways to make that simple storyline interesting. Kon's expert storytelling and the incredible cinematics of Perfect Blue make it well worth watching. The camera angles and the way scenes are spliced together is incredible. The more Mima becomes uncertain of her world, the more the audience becomes unsure of what they're seeing. Was that last scene a dream or reality? When the scene repeats -- is the second version reality? Or is it a dream? Or were they both dreams? The ambiguity of what is and isn't can be frustrating at times, but in the end, the effectiveness of the storytelling outweighs any real need to know what was and wasn't. CHARACTER - Excellent. Mima's psychological descent is well-played. Her insecurity and uncertainty about her decisions and identity is easy to believe, so it's easy to sympathize with her -- always an important thing. This allows the resulting drama some leeway as far as realism goes, and you're able to take on a lot more without thinking that any of it is over-the-top or ridiculous. It's hard to elaborate too much on her ordeal without giving everything away, but yeah... Mima's character is great all around. The secondary characters are of mostly of the sort that play one specific role and that's it. This works well enough since the film is essentially about Mima's mental and emotional state, and that makes detailed exploration of other characters more or less pointless. Still, Me-Mania (the stalker) and Mima's managerial staff are very effective in that they give away many clues as to what's really going on without explicitly revealing anything. It's a good mystery, and it's killing me to not talk about certain characters, but I hate giving away spoilers even more. :3 ARTSTYLE &amp; ANIMATION - Perfect Blue had some amazing artwork in it -- the sets and scenes were very well rendered and I was particularly pleased with the realistic treatments of the female body in the various scenes that featured it. It isn't often you get nipples and pubes, anyway. There were some strange stylistic quirks in some characters though; thinking back, if they did it on purpose, it was a very clever way to set some characters apart from others, but otherwise, it just leaves you wondering why they failed on the facial anatomy here and again when, for the most part, everything and everyone else looks excellent. The animation was smooth and beautiful, and again, despite being an animated film, the cinematography was very much suited for a live action film. The way scenes transitioned and were put together was just amazing. Very well done indeed. MUSIC - This movie had a very, very effective soundtrack. Suspenseful scenes were enhanced by suspenseful music, but it wasn't so in-your-face that it felt over-the-top or corny. I'll be the first to admit that some of those jumpy scenes freaked me out, and the music played no small part in that. The less dramatic scenes naturally had less noticeable music. Mima's former pop trio CHAM!'s music was pretty generic-feeling, but that was probably the point. It was cute, and that was about it. VOICE ACTING - I saw this movie subbed. The cast was pretty average for the most part, but I really appreciated Junko Iwao's role as Mima because Mima herself is an actor. The range of emotion she goes through is pretty amazing, and the voice acting in those very high-tension (rape) scenes is very convincing (maybe even disturbingly so). OVERALL - I really enjoyed Perfect Blue. I walked into it knowing little more than that it was a Satoshi Kon movie (that's a plenty good enough reason to see it!), and to that extent, it definitely doesn't disappoint. The reality/fantasy theme that's so prevalent in Kon's later works is already here in full force, and I'd venture to say that the blur is even more effective here than it is in later works like Paprika and Paranoia Agent. It's worth repeating again that the cinematics are nothing short of amazing. The story is polished and has an excellent climax and ending; the character(s) are well-developed and well-played. The music is fitting, and the acting is top notch where it needs to be. Maybe watching it alone at 4am made it all the more suspenseful for me, but I'm sure it's just as enjoyable to see with friends in the middle of the afternoon. ;3 Helpful",5359,Positive,Positive,Perfect Blue's classic insecurity-themed story is elevated by Kon's expert storytelling and cinematics.,"{""sentiment"":""Positive"",""summary"":""Perfect Blue's classic insecurity-themed story is elevated by Kon's expert storytelling and cinematics.""}

52587,8425,Gosick,"['Mystery', 'Historical', 'Drama', 'Romance']",366457,245,387.0,8.0,"Everything ahead is my own personal opinion, written on little sleep. Do not take anything as 100% perfect, and please try to work through parts that don't make complete sense. Gosick is, to be honest, a very strange anime. Not strange as in weird or creepy, like Madoka, or even something you may have to watch multiple time, like FLCL, but it's strange because not every part of it necessarily fits together. And that's going to turn some people off. Story: 7 I'm sort of torn on the story. If you were to summarize the story into one sentence, it would probably go something like: ""Gosick is about an extremely smart young girl and a Japanese boy who solve mysteries using science,"" or something. Now, this is all fine and dandy, even if it is a bit absurd. Many of the cases tackled are solved using a string of logic, meshing the small bits of evidence together to solve the case. It's not a particularly bad way to do it, but it's not particularly good either, as some of the cases can become pretty confusing if you're not paying attention well enough. The small bits of evidence also don't hold up as well as the bits of evidence in say, Phoenix Write or similar more-standard detective/mystery stories. However, the cases are relatively enjoyable, even if you can see the end (or parts of the end) to some of them. However, being able to guess the end of a case is not a bad thing, as it makes everything a little more believable. However, it quickly takes the turn of becoming a romance anime, again, something which isn't necessarily bad. I personally didn't mind it, though most of the romance is very stereotypical. Just be warned, though, if you don't like romance in your mystery, do NOT watch Gosick. At its end it is a romance anime, not a mystery anime, which, as I said before, may turn people off. However, if you take off the last episode, you have a mystery ending. While it doesn't make the cop-out of ""all these cases were one huge conspiracy!"", the cases themselves aren't connected all that much, save the end two. Each could probably exist separately, and it wouldn't have made a lick of difference. Art: 8 Honestly, there's not much to say. It's not a particularly good looking anime, but it certainly isn't ugly. There seems to be a focus on shiny and glass things, most of which look pretty good. I also really love the bright, vibrant eyes of some of the characters, but I'm a weird person, so take that as you will. Sound: 8 Again, not a whole lot to say. The sound itself is pretty standard. The music is decent, though I prefer the first OP/ED to the second. However, the game takes place in a French-speaking country, but the anime is in Japanese, of course. Normally, this wouldn't be a huge problem (like with anime that take place in English-speaking places), but there are a few times where the main character's Japanese heritage and language are referenced, which make the whole thing feel slightly awkward. Of course, I can't think of a way to fix this without changing the whole thing, so I won't be too harsh in score about it. Characters: 7 If you've read some of the more negative reviews on MAL, they mention how absurd the main female character (Victorique) is. How preposterous it is that a 12-year-old is outwitting practically an entire country's police force. However, it's not particularly ""magical,"" nor is it particularly absurd. If you take a sliding scale from ""average"" people to, say, savants, Victorique would be less ""average"" and more ""savant."" While she doesn't particularly lack many social skills, she does possess a very high intelligence, which isn't really all that strange. She simply follows a better string of logic, and is better at finding clues and relevant information than most of the characters in the story. That's all there is to it. No magic. No weirdness, and actually sort of grounded and reality. I found it pretty believable, in that respect. Now, on to the rest of them. This is probably my biggest problem with the show. Every main character (and even the side characters) have personalities more fitting to a modern-day setting. I'm not saying ditzy klutz teachers and egotistical drill-hair detectives didn't exist in the early 1900s, but they just seem unfitting. However, I do get that historical accuracy does sometimes need to be sacrificed to make the characters interesting, but I think it could have been done a little more gracefully. Enjoyment/overall: Overall, I really enjoyed watching Gosick. Before I knew it, it was over. It's a mystery anime that shifts to a love story. The filler episodes are a bit more slice-of-life, which provide a good lift from the sometimes creepy and gruesome scenarios in the main story. I think it has enough for most people to enjoy some part of it. So, as with anything, try it for a few episodes. If you end up not loving it, and find it a drag to keep watching, you don't have to finish it. We're not going to cut off your head or burn you alive or anything.

The anime is very cutesy and charming and i'll admit the main reason I didn't watch it sooner was because the main characters are so young. I guess I misjudged it. This is a slice of life anime so there's little plot. Every episode is just a collection of small stories adapted from the manga. The character writing is where this anime shines. Nishikata narrates everything with his internal monologue so you get a good idea of how he thinks, and Tagaki is very cunning and unafraid to push his buttons. The end result is lots of cute scenes between them. I only have a couple of minor complaints. I was a bit disappointed with how Nishikata never really grows out of being constantly flustered and embarrassed. You'd think that after spending months being teased by Tagaki he would start to develop a thicker skin, but throughout the entire series he is just constantly embarrassed and overthinking everything. In moderation this would have been charming, but they overused it a bit too much. There are also complaints about this anime ignoring a certain chapter from the manga (#31). Since there's a lot of chapters in the manga that were missed, it might just be that they were planning for a second season where they could use the remaining unused chapters. I dunno. The series did have a kind of anticlimactic ending so I can see why some people might be upset. The art, sound and voice acting are all fine. I personally didn't really like how the characters had weirdly shaped balloon heads but that's a personal gripe.

57957,7465,Eve no Jikan (Movie),"['Sci-Fi', 'Slice of Life']",95709,1144,434.0,9.0,"How ""human"" are we? I've been asking myself this very question after watching Eve no Jikan. I'll go ahead and save you some minutes of reading: watch Eve no Jikan. It's intriguing, it's engaging, and above all else it's entertaining. For those interested as to knowing why, I'll explain below. I just came across Eve no Jikan by accident one day in someone's list, and I gave it a shot. I guess I'm just the type of person who can't say no to shows that tackle androids. However, I was expecting some tacky storyline with androids as human partners and all that. Eve no Jikan, however, defied my expectations and gave me an engaging story that made me ask myself ""What would I do if I was in his shoes?"" once the movie ended. Few shows, never mind movies, give me that kind of aftereffect; Eve no Jikan manages to do it so well I'm still thinking about it now. Story: 10/10 This is probably the strongest point of the movie. The story tackles a distant future where humanoid robots called androids are working among us humans, doing some of the jobs we humans are too busy to do. It tells of a student named Sakisaka Rikuo who discovers a weird log on the operational log of their household android named Sammy. He is then led to a café named Time of Eve (or Eve no Jikan, hence the title of the movie), with a rule that states that there should be no discrimination between humans and androids. The movie is simply a combination of three short animations, so you'd expect some disjoint stories. Eve no Jikan, however, manages to stitch them all together due to the presence of the café itself, with regular customers and the occasional newcomer. What makes the story strong is how it handles the ethical and social issues that are bound to be present in a society that uses robots that resemble humans in every outward physical detail. The movie presents some rules on androids that every androids (and every androids manufacturer) must follow. It tackles people who think of androids as equals, people who think androids are unnecessary and are detrimental to society, androids who think and behave like normal humans and everything else in between. It does so fluidly and in an ordered fashion so as not to impose multiple issues on the viewer at once, yet still somehow interrelated and just as significant as the previous issue presented. Art: 8/10 I have a bias for good, clean art; this movie does it very well. With bright, neon-colored signs typically present in futuristic settings, and styles that make androids differ so little from normal humans (androids have light rings on their heads to differentiate them from humans; the café instructs androids to turn the said light rings off so as not to cause discrimination between humans and androids). Nevertheless, art is very nice and fitting for the movie. Sound: 7/10 If you're looking for some upbeat backtones, you won't find it here (no one fights shounen manga-style here). However, the background music is just enough to stir emotions within the viewer or to present undertones within the scene, and does not overpower the scene itself. I might say that it's quite fitting for a movie like this that makes its viewers think for a change. Voice acting, on the other hand, is excellent. Each one does his or her character justice, and if on voices alone, even the viewers can't differentiate a human from an android when inside the café. As a point of interest, Fukuyama Jun voices the main character Sakisaka Rikuo--the same guy who did voice acting for Lelouch in Code Geass. How awesome is that? Character: 9/10 In hearing ""androids"" as characters, you're probably expecting some clunky voices reminiscent of Stephen Hawking (no offense to the man; he's a great man with a great mind), as I did. However, I was completely mistaken, as the characters are equally well-presented. Each is given a sufficient backstory to keep our curiosities satisfied, and expounds when necessary. Each one, human or android, possesses a different personality when in the outside world or when inside the café; in fact, viewers won't even know the difference unless the main characters encounter them outside the café. Also, don't let the ""android"" thing confuse you; the androids have as much personality as any other human in the movie. All the more reason to ask yourself the questions presented in the movie, I say. Enjoyment: 9/10 Overall, Eve no Jikan is a treasure of a spectacle that everyone deserves to watch. It caters to no specific class of viewers, so everyone can appreciate it no matter what your inclinations to animé are. It brings you a story that makes you question how human you really are, and makes you ask what a human really is.

In order to stand out it needs to do something to be fresh, exciting, or just different enough to be worth the watch. Alderamin on the Sky tries to do this, and seems promising at first, but it doesn't follow through on the things it tries to do different. Instead it plays it safe as the 13 episode series comes to it's end. Story: Our five main characters luck their way into High ranking status by saving the princess after the boat that was taking them to the military exam began to sink (for no apparent reason, other than plot convenience). They find themselves involved in a war, the cause of which is discovered through the development of the plot. The story slogs along for the first few episodes. It takes a little while before the main plot comes into fruition, but once it does, it becomes one of it's stronger aspects. With that said, I'm disappointed that the series didn't dive further into the spirits or the Alderamin religion as a whole. The war is based on this fictional religion and these spirits that are largely unexplored. 6/10 Characters: Ikta is the only character of the main 5 that feel developed enough for me to be invested in. I appreciate the fact that despite the events that lead to him being in a high ranking position, of which he does not want, his demeanor towards his peers, the princess especially, remains largely unchanged. He treats her as a friend and person, rather than a princess. He has a brutal honesty about him that is refreshing and relatable. His decisions in battle are well thought out, and the series does a good job of explaining them well enough to keep them being unbelievable or convoluted. Yatorishino has some development as well, but not nearly enough past the ""Do what I must to protect my country"" persona she has at the beginning of the series. Torway, Matthew and Haroma get way too little screen time for me to even consider then as main characters. They are likable in the time they are on screen, but even some supporting characters are more involved than they are. Suuya is one of those supporting characters and I appreciate the way she carries herself. 7/10 Art: The art so far has been adequate, but some questionable choices were made in the battles that can be noticed all within the same episode.. The battle at the end of episode 4 was a glimpse of how good this series can look. The camera focuses on the character that is doing the most damage as they weave in an out of enemies, striking them down effortlessly. A battle that takes place just beforehand is poorly executed. It consists of extremely zoomed out wide shots of a battle taking place. When the camera zooms in, it doesn't show any of the battle in the forefront, but rather characters planning their next course of action while the real action happens around them. When they do focus on the action, the scenes are very interesting, I just wish they would be done that more. 5/10 Sound: Sounds effects are interesting. During one moment, gunshots are loud and blown out. The next, it simulates how a person would hear after just having been involved in a bloody battle. The OST is filled with wartime- style horn pieces that fit very well within the action setpieces. The voice acting (DUB) is less than stellar in my opinion. While characters like Ikta and YatorIshino fit well with their respective VA's, characters like Senpa and Matthew sound wooden and underwhelming. 6/10 Overall, I give this series a 6/10.

In his wanderings he catches the eye of Griffith, the young leader of an up-and-coming band of mercenaries. The meeting isn't a happy one. Guts kill some of Griffith's men and Griffith stabs Guts in the chest. But Griffith is taken with Guts' skills, and duels with him to force him into his mercenary corps, the fabled Band of the Hawk. Years pass. Despite his hot temper and frequent clashes with Griffith's lady lieutenant Casca, Guts has made his place in the Band and grown fast friends with the brilliant and ambitious Griffith. Through siege and raid, against man and immortal demon, assassin and scheming noble, Griffith and his band rise ever victorious through Midland's ranks. And always at his right hand is fierce Guts, trusted with all the dirtiest and most dangerous of his tasks. You know, I actually have something to tell you about me looking into the series and the movies….well, the first movie and the fact that I watch that first even before heading into the series. I know that the movies are more manga-centered as it covers as the film states The Golden Age Arc and I know for a fact that the movies is parallel to Berserk TV episodes 2-10, only with slightly advanced animation and speaking of that, the animation has switched from Oriental Light & Magic to Studio 4°C and like the TV series, there is some bad flaws to it, such as it can look a bit clunky and jarring at times and the CG often clashes with the background, making it look more fake than it already is, however, some characters do look more detailed than the TV series and the backgrounds are slightly more appealing to look at. For the story and those who have already seen the show, this is more of a cliffs’ notes version of what happened in the series, only bringing the important details and nix the unnecessary and unnoticeable parts although I feel less interaction with some of Griffith’s crew and possibly even less for Casca. I know that in the later movies, they might be featured more into the limelight but it felt like they were just there for…..well, just there. Characters and their traits are the same in here as in the TV show so no going through that again. Musically, the score was done by Shiro Sagisu this time around and it was a pretty good score, maybe not as much as Susumu Hirasawa but he did help with the theme song of the movie and the song is good and all, but it will never be a “FORCES” or “Guts’ Theme” in my eyes. And for the English dub, Viz Media actually got the original cast and crew from NYAV Post to do the dub and while I think since the show’s dub was hit or miss, the movie’s dub is well-done, bringing back Marc Diraison, Kevin T. Collins & Carolyn Keranen in their roles of Guts, Griffith, and Casca respectively and even Collins as Griffith has made more of a better effort in this edition. FINAL VERDICT: I guess that if you want to know about Berserk in general aside from the manga but you wanted to be in a shorter length, then the movie is designated towards you. However, if you already seen the series, then you probably would think differently about this. It’s still a good movie but for approximately 80 minutes, it feels slightly minuscule for something as epic as the name of Berserk.

172405,210,Ranma ½,"['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'Martial Arts', 'Fantasy', 'Shounen']",161913,687,866.0,6.0,"During my sophomore year of high school, I was getting back into anime after a short hiatus and one particular series that I actually picked up because I heard of it from Robot Chicken was Ranma 1/2, and before you ask: yes, Robot Chicken really did a sketch inspired by Ranma 1/2 and it's hilarious. What really drew me to this particular series outside of the obvious was the fact that it was done by Rumiko Takahashi: the same person who made InuYasha. Back then, I had this completely asinine idea in my head that if the person who made my favourite series worked on another series, it would be just as good to me if not better. Yeah... I kinda had to learn that wasn't always true when I picked up Ranma 1/2. Don't get me wrong: I genuinely did enjoy watching Ranma once upon a time, but that enjoyment slowly dissipated and turned into boredom and annoyance as time went on. I understand this isn't really a ""fair"" comparison, since InuYasha came out several years after Ranma finished its run but I see way too many people comparing it to that despite some rather glaring differences (even in the points where people claim it to be similar). For starters, Rumiko Takahashi has this habit of using a will-they-wont-they dynamic which I find rather irritating nowadays considering the fact that I actually want my romances to go somewhere. The way Rumiko Takahashi uses this dynamic in Ranma amounts to nothing more than stalling. Some episodes there would be a couple of moments I found rather sweet going on between Ranma and Akane, and the next moment, Akane is beating the shit out of Ranma for no apparent reason. The difference between InuYasha's romance and Ranma's romance is that it actually goes SOMEWHERE!!!! Kagome and Inuyasha managed to come to terms with their feelings for one another as did Miroku and Sango! No such thing happens in Ranma for reasons I'll explain in a paragraph or two later. Once upon a time, Ranma did have a plot behind it. Initially, the story was about Ranma trying to find a way to undo the curse placed upon him that causes him to turn into a girl but that little plot point soon got thrown to the wayside as Takahashi opted to focus more on short arcs and episodic comedy moments. It also doesn't help that the Ranma anime overtook the manga frequently and had to keep using redundant filler episodes to stall for time. If I'm not mistaken, it's these factors alone which caused the Ranma anime to be cancelled before it could air the rest of the story (Huh.. it would seem that our good friends at Studio DEEN managed to fuck up other shows with shitty filler before doing Rurouni Kenshin). It also doesn't help that Ranma 1/2 is also a harem series... did I forget to mention that because it's kind of important? Now when it comes down to being a harem series, Ranma 1/2 DOES have some merits to stand on. The thing is that this series has Ranma dealing with multiple obligations to marry because his amoral father just got him into that mess for laughs, so at least it's not like Love Hina. HOWEVER... Ranma 1/2 is also the progenitor for the much-maligned love dodecahedron trope that never ceases to make me rage (it's one of the reasons why I lack the will to keep watching Nagi no Asukara despite the fact that I've only got 6 episodes left at the time of writing). Say what you will about InuYasha, but the worst that it actually had was the Kikyo vs. Kagome debate. Here, we have multiple obligations to marry, people who want Ranma/Akane for themselves, blah blah blah. You get the picture, right? One of the MANY reasons why I'm not a particular fan of love polygons/harems is because of the fact that it's so blatantly obvious who's going to end up with whom and yet the author decides to fuck with our ships because romantic tension? I don't know but it's not cool so please stop doing that shit. Don't even get me started on how Akane is a violent tsundere. Once upon a time, I actually found that shit funny but now it's one of those tropes that I just can't deal with anymore. Okay, there are some exceptions like Kaori from Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, Shana from Shakugan no Shana, and Taiga from Toradora (the latter two to a certain degree) but Akane is NOT one of them. Really, what the fuck do people like so much about tsunderes to begin with, especially if they're obnoxious and aggressive like Akane is? Why would ANYONE want Akane to be their waifu if she's prone to beating the shit out of you without good reason? Are you people masochists or something? Okay, that's not entirely fair to say since Akane does have her cute moments but her obnoxious tsundere moments far outweigh the moments where I found her to be a good character. Maybe I'm just taking Ranma 1/2 too seriously. I mean, it IS primarily a comedy series, right? Well here's the problem: I don't really find this shit funny anymore. Okay, that's not entirely true since I still get *some* amusement out of watching random episodes (especially episodes from Season 4-onward when Richard Ian Cox takes over as Ranma's English voice actor). At the same time, I just don't get the same kind of amusement from watching Akane beat the shit out of Ranma for whatever reason or watching Ranma behave immodestly whilst he's a girl like I used to. I get so caught up in the lack of realism to the point where I end up frustrating myself and I just want to close the tab I have open and watch an episode or two of Ed Edd n Eddy just to regain my composure. Am I a pleb who has no taste in the so-called ""classics"" like everyone else does? Eh, probably. One thing's for sure though: Ranma 1/2 is among the many programmes and mangas which have long since fallen off my radar. I suppose I could go ahead and read Busou Renkin to see if Nobuhiro Watsuki was the one behind it but my experiences with Ranma make me hesitate to do so. The moral of the story, children? Shows and mangas aren't automatically good just because the guy/girl who made your favourite series created another series. With that said, I suppose Ranma 1/2 is good enough. It's one of those shows that works best in small doses, just don't expect to sit through the entire thing and you should be fine. Feedback is always welcome, and with that I'm out.

188370,820,Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu,"['Military', 'Sci-Fi', 'Space', 'Drama']",175423,620,8.0,9.0,"Overview: It finally happened. I'm finally going to review what is probably the most beloved anime on all of MAL. An anime so sacred that even trolls on 4chan don't dare to insult it and sully its glorious name! I'm sure everyone reading this review is already quite aware how amazing this anime is, so I am going to talk about WHY it's so good, why you should watch it, and even discuss some minor imperfections (gasp). I'm finally on Summer break from medical school, so I can afford to write a long review! I picked the right series for this! Legend of the Galactic Heroes is so grand scale and epic in terms of plot complexity and number of characters, that I feel it would overwhelm the reader if I actually tried during this review to summarize everything that happens in the plot and describe all the characters. This review would be at least 20 Microsoft Word pages long! Instead, I shall divide the review into strong points and minor imperfections. WARNING! SPOILERS!!!! Why is LOTGH so good? 1. The characters. It has an absolutely massive cast of characters that captures a wide range of personality types, morality, and world outlooks. I could write ALL DAY talking about the different characters, so instead I am just going to talk about the main 2 characters. The main character is the ambitious Reinhardt von Lohengramm, who wishes to overthrow the corrupt monarchy and conquer the galaxy to create a new age of prosperity with him leading it. Reinhardt seems to take personality traits and characteristics from several historical figures including Fredrick the Great, Julius Caesar, and Alexander the Great. For example, like Julius Caesar he sees a less than satisfactory government and believes that he is the man that can lead his nation to greatness, even if it means overturning the old order. Also like Julius Caesar, he dies immediately after establishing his empire and doesn't live to enjoy the fruit of his labor. This would also be true of Japan's Oda Nobunaga, who ended the Warring States period and unified Japan, only to get betrayed by one of his generals and forced to commit suicide. Reinhardt actually dies of natural causes unlike those 2, but the result is the same. Like Fredrick the Great, Reinhardt is absolutely brilliant, yet highly introverted and emotionally distant. Also like Fredrick, he is only truly close to one trusted male assistant, leading many to question his heterosexuality. Interestingly, Reinhardt shares this latter trait with Alexander as well. Reinhardt will sometimes resort to ruthless tactics to accomplish his goals, but he has a strong moral conscience and suffers whenever he does. This internal conflict gives depth to Reinhardt's character and makes him easily the most interesting character to watch. Note that I used the word interesting and not necessarily most likeable. The most likeable character for most viewers is actually the series deuteragonist, named Yang Wenli. Although Yang is extremely likeable and I too love Yang, he is simply too perfect and lacks human flaws that the audience can identify with. He doesn't resemble any historical generals because no one that nice was ever a successful general. The only person Yang resembles is the tank commander from the video game Valkyria Chronicles. Like Valkyria's Welkin Gunther, Yang is a highly quirky, loveable goofball that also happens to be the world's greatest tactician. Despite his godlike gift for military tactics, he doesn't want to be in the military and wishes to be a teacher, but feels obligated to continue protecting the lives of his men once he starts serving. Perhaps Yang's closest link to several historical generals is his unabashed alcoholism and propensity to get sauced. However, Yang is known for never just throwing men at the obstacle, always having highly intricate strategies, and almost always winning the kill ratio. Ultimately, I feel Yang is simply too perfect for his own good, which effects his character depth and overall development. I still love him though! 2. The Politics and Themes. If you thought Game of Thrones had a complex tapestry of politics, then you haven't seen LOTGH. Not only is the sheer number of subplots that the show manages to perfectly tie together impressive, but the show deals with real world problems of governance. Like the epic novel ""War and Peace"" used war to examine philosophical problems and arguments ranging from agricultural reform to the ""Great Man"" theory of history, LOTGH uses war to examine the question of whether corrupt democracy is truly better than a well led monarchy. Instead of just spoon feeding the audience the answer that democracy is better and monarchy sucks, like Victor Hugo spent about 400 pages doing in his novel ""Les Misrables"", LOTGH actually examines the benefits and flaws of both systems and allows the viewer to make their own decision. Holy Shit! LOTGH arguably tackled a topic better than Hugo, one of the greatest novelists of all time. I'm not saying LOTGH is a better work of art obviously since Hugo wins the prose contest by...quite a bit. I'm saying that in terms of debating a key topic, LOTGH really did a better job and for that deserves some serious credit! In terms of literature, LOTGH reminds me quite a bit of Asimov's Foundation series, mixed with Star Wars so it isn't quite so boring and without the absolute obsession with math. Asimov had a jawdropping IQ of 175, which probably QUITE a bit higher than Tanaka's. However...I actually like LOTGH more than Foundation as a work of art! I'm serious! I'm not saying it is objectively better since valid arguments could be made in favor of Foundation , but I AM saying that I personally liked it a LOT more! 3. The Music. If you love classical music than THIS is your anime. Fuck Shigatsu! This has a HUGE selection of great composers and classical works including Mahler, Beethoven, Brahms, Chopin, Schubert, and of course Wagner in keeping with the extreme length of this series. All music is performed by top rated orchestras, so it sounds fantastic! Although Bebop or Rurouni Kenshin probably have the best ORIGINAL soundtracks, LOTGH probably has the best non-original and best overall soundtrack in all of anime! Now is the part of the review that may anger some people. If you are such a raging LOTGH fanboy that any criticism makes you angry, you may wish to stop reading here. Why might people NOT like LOTGH? 1. The plot. Didn't I just get done explaining how awesome the plot was? Yes I did, but that doesn't mean it is perfect. It still does do some things that might annoy picky viewers, as I will explain. The entire series involves massive space battles and intricate battlefield tactics that the author Tanaka learned from reading military history. The problem is that he uses REAL battlefield tactics like semi-circle formation, phalanx, the oblique echelon formation used at the Battle of Leuctra in Ancient Greece. So what is the problem with this? Those tactics were designed for fighting on a 2 dimensional plane where your opponents can move side to side and back and forward, but NOT up and down...like if you were FIGHTING IN OUTER SPACE! The 2 BRILLIANT tacticians Yang Weng Li and Fuhrer Reinhardt play 3-D chess using exclusively 2-D strategies. Another problem is that LOTGH makes the HIGHLY unlikely assumption that space warfare will closely resemble land warfare in the 1700s where winning is determined by raw infantry numbers and field position. Each army has about 50,000 mini-star destroyers, which basically replace individual soldiers. The battles are then based off classical battles that Tanaka read about. Space warfare in my opinion would much more likely resemble naval warfare, where navies are ranked by ""tonnage"" NOT total numbers. A fleet of 11 Nimitz class Aircraft carriers would annihilate an armada of 50,000 speed boats. Naval wars are won and lost not by numbers, but rather by a smaller number of big, important boats. The Empire is revealed to have a giant fortress ripoff of the Death Star that was able to devastate the entire Alliance fleet on 5 occasions with its Death beam. Yet despite the existence of this technology, the empire makes 1 immobile Death Star and 50,000 Star Destroyers. If they had used the same resources to make about 20 mobile Death Stars, they would have slaughtered the Alliance with ease. I guess Tanaka never played Masters of Orion 2? LOTGH also puts WAY too much emphasis on brilliant generals being the factor that wins and loses wars using the ""Great Man"" theory of history that no historian has taken seriously since Napoleon lost 200 years ago. Wars are won and lost by logistics, which speaking of logistics brings me to another problem: The logistics, world building, and timeline of this series! Firstly, I will defend Tanaka by saying that some authors, like my personal favorite Dostoevsky, care a LOT more about their themes, messages, and characters, than they do about the plot element. This would actually describe the majority of esteemed classical authors, so Tanaka is in good company by not caring as much about the plot. However, that doesn't actually excuse the author from being completely sloppy with the plot and creating plotholes and continuity errors out the ass! Tanaka doesn't give a FUCK about the plot, and I will absolutely prove it to you! If you look at the timeline, you will notice that in 150 years a group of 400,000 refugees were able to increase their population to 400 million by the time of the first encounter between the Alliance and Empire. This was BEFORE, immigration from the Empire bolstered the Alliance population. An isolated population was able to increase by 1,000 times in 8 generations. Also keep in mind that this was without MASSIVE cloning, because the Alliance citizens are very diverse and clearly they aren't all clones produced on a conveyor belt like the Clone Troopers in Star Wars. Maybe they were mass produced test tube babies with lots of egg and semen samples to make a diverse crop with artificial insemination? It never states this, so I think it is more likely that Tanaka simply wasn't thinking about the logistics of his timeline. This becomes more likely when you consider the following fuck up. We learn that Earth had a population of 20 billion before a nuclear war reduced it to 1 billion around 2050 AD. The vast majority of the remaining 1 billion people leave Earth and colonize space, leaving just a few million people on highly irradiated and inhospitable Earth. Yet 200 years later, the colonies fight a war with Earth and slaughter 5 billion people by nuking Earth from orbit. Why the FUCK were 5 billion people living on a post nuclear war Earth when we had colonized dozens of planets by that time? Unless the 5 million or so stragglers fucked their brains out and increased 1,000 times in 200 years, which once again is impossible (Nigeria tried HARD and only managed 17X growth in 200 years), or a shitload of people migrated back to a nuclear wasteland out of sheer idiocy. It gets worse. We hear again and again how Earth was rendered completely uninhabitable after the 2nd nuking, yet at the end of the series...there are motherfuckers shown living on Earth again less than a thousand years later! The series went on so long that Tanaka just completely forgot what he wrote! These are the kind of mistakes and highly questionable logistics that plague the timeline. This is a plot that is best examined from a distance, because the closer you look, the more you notice shit like this. 2. the art. Since this is an older series, the art and animation is fairly dated. This didn't bother me, but it might bother some viewers. 3. The pacing. This series is LOOONG! I mean like Longcat long. It is also extremely slow at times and requires a large amount of patience. LOTGH fans will tell people, ""don't worry, it starts getting good around episode 60!"". The sad thing is that they aren't entirely joking. Not every anime watcher will want to watch a series where the first 26 episodes are basically just an introduction. 4. The sorrow. Do you have a favorite character? He's going to die. I fucking guarantee it. Almost EVERY loveable character dies in this fucking series, and they don't die happy old men. Overall: As much as I bash MAL's ratings and question the dogma of anime forums like reddit and /a/ on 4chan , I will admit that with Legend of the Galactic Heroes...people actually got it right. This REALLY is a great anime that deserves all the praise it gets! Is it a perfect anime with zero flaws? No. I think I just demonstrated a few reasons why some people might not think so. However, I personally really like this series overall and give it a very well deserved 9/10.

43617,9941,Tiger & Bunny,"['Action', 'Mystery', 'Comedy', 'Super Power']",162364,682,589.0,9.0,"Coming in as a Western anime fan it is hard to not be skeptical of an anime about superheroes. Considering our own comic book industry and how it contrasts to anime in general, I almost would never consider the possibility of an anime successfully capturing the world of superheroes. Perhaps this is why I consider Tiger & Bunny to be one of the most pleasant surprises I have seen in quite a while. Tiger & Bunny is a story about corporate sponsored superheroes called ""Next"", essentially mutants like those of X Men, who are constantly filmed on television in Sternbuild City. By engaging in heroic acts the superheroes are given points in a contest to determine who the ""King of Heroes"" is, and by doing better in the competition the heroes provide better advertising for their sponsors. The premise of the story lends itself to an interesting twist on superhero ideals. This is best represented by our two main characters Kotetsu who is known as the superhero Wild Tiger, and Barnaby, who Kotetsu nicknames Bunny. Kotetsu starts out the show as an old and washed up hero who believes in superhero ideals that are considered old fashioned by his peers. He values justice above all else, makes saving people his top priority, and could care less about what the sponsors want. On the other hand, we have Barnaby, or Bunny, who got into the hero business as an avenger seeking justice for his parents' death. At the start he only really cares about earning points in the hero competition, and doesn't place that much importance on Kotetsu's old fashioned ideas, and does everything to appease all the sponsors. The partnership that Barnaby would form with Kotetsu, Tiger & Bunny, would go on to be the defining relationship of the show. Their clash of ideals would lead both on to balancing each other out, as well as serve as one of the most amusing sources of comedy throughout the entire show's run. It should be stressed that Tiger & Bunny, while not afraid to get serious at times, is overall a very fun and entertaining story about superheroes. The character interactions and development are often very amusing, and the world is built up magnificently. While also having nice action scenes throughout the story, Tiger & Bunny's greatest strength would definitely have to be its character building. As a great character driven story, the cast ends up being very likable and well made. Another remarkable aspect of this show is its seamless ability to blend Western superheros into the world of anime. The costume and abilities of Kotetsu as Wild Tiger are all too familiar of more Western heroes, as are the villains like Jake Martinez who capture the Western psychopathic antagonist really well. I give the show a lot of praise because of its ability to connect to me as a Western fan, especially when so many animes are so confined in the Japenese markets. Overall, the show just manages to be a fun, and adventurous tale. It is one of the least offensive shows out there, and can be recommended to almost anyone. This show is perfect for anyone who gives a damn about superheroes, but is also compelling enough for almost anyone to enjoy. I hope to see more anime like this in the future.

257444,35247,Owarimonogatari 2nd Season,"['Mystery', 'Comedy', 'Supernatural', 'Vampire']",189944,573,18.0,10.0,"In order to fulfill a promise made to expert Izuko Gaen, a woman who claims to know everything, Araragi meets up with his lovely underclassman Suruga Kanbaru to mediate a meeting between Kanbaru and his Aunt Gaen. However, Araragi's plan quickly dwindles when the couple are attacked by a suit of sensitive armor that seeks to retrieve the sword of the Kokorowatari demon who bowed to Araragi's vampire companion Shinobu 400 years ago. After the three fantastic and unique bows seen in Owarimonogatari Part 1, the final arc of the 6-episode Shinobu Mail returns to a more traditional Monogatari feel while maintaining the same high-quality quality that we expect from the franchise, although it still has some of the same small flaws . To get off a bit of a tangent before getting into the late meat of Owarimonogatari, I just want to quickly touch the chronology of the Monogatari franchise and how it has become a mess. This is my second time watching Owarimonogatari, but when I hit the first episode 1 of Shinobu Mail, I was confused as hell about the time when the episode was actually taking place. None of the second season bows on are chronological and it soon becomes difficult to really know where you stand on the timeline in any episode. Although the first episode of Shinobu Mail briefly recaptures the events of Shinobu Time (also known as Onimonogatari), I still had to do a little research to get a good idea of ​​what exactly was going on. A re-watch of Onimonogatari is definitely recommended before jumping into the Shinobu Mail, unless you are feeling very confident in your knowledge of the Monogatari timeline. Confronting chronology aside, I still really enjoyed the Shinobu Mail, though perhaps not as much as some of the arches in Owarimonogatari Part 1. As I mentioned earlier, Shinobu Mail drops the mysterious nature of Ougi Formula, Sodachi Riddle and Sodachi Lost in favor of something more reminiscent of Monogatari's second season, which was highly anticipated, given the nature of this bow as a sequel and conclusion to the Second Season, Shinobu Time Bow. This bow deals with the direct consequences of Shinobu's time, and in fact makes me enjoy this bow much more now I have seen Shinobu Mail as it relieves many complaints I had about it. Much of Shinobu's time, I dedicate myself to telling the public the story of Shinobu, which only seems unnecessary, but the story here justifies everything, and finally gives this side of Shinobu's time an appropriate conclusion. I'll say that Shinobu Mail's placement may be a little questionable, and may have served better as a Season 2 bow, but since the chronology is all over the place anyway, it probably does not make much difference. The only complaint I have, as before, comes in the rhythm and the Shinobu Mail suffers in this respect. The last half of Episode 3 and most of Episode 4 are devoted to an unbelievably large expose of Izuko Gaen, and as such, the pace only diminishes, while the public is bombarded with pure information for half an hour. The visuals are still fantastic and relieve the overload a bit, but I can not help but feel that it could have been reduced a bit to make a faster pace. I was also quite disappointed with the absence of the mysterious Ougi, who was quite prominent in Owarimonogatari Part 1, being reduced to a cameo appearance, but since this only fits part of the novel of Owarimonogatari, with Owarimonogatari Season 2 being transmitted in the Summer Of 2017, I can forgive you, under the assumption that it will present strongly in later arcs. As is the norm for most of the Monogatari bows at this point, the Shinobu Mail is really about their characters, and is certainly a front that this bow offers in spades. Surprisingly, the character who takes the most out of this bow is not the titular Shinobu, but Kanbaru of all people. Of the many, many girls who feature the franchise, Kanbaru is easily more underutilized, so I was incredibly happy to see her in an important role here. Not only does she provide a really excellent mood in her dealings with Araragi, whom she jumps superbly, which makes for an amazing chemistry, but she also gets a scene with Shinobu in the penultimate episode, which may actually be one of My favorites all over series. Kanbaru is widely used for comic relief, a role for which she is suitable, but her scene with Shinobu proves she can be so much more. Despite having his name, Shinobu does not have much time on the screen, but the above-mentioned scene with Kanbaru is great for her and Kanbaru. I'm sure we did not see Kanbaru and Shinobu together before, but I'd love to see more. I would also be very remiss if I did not mention another very bright scene in the final episode, and between Araragi and his girlfriend Senjogahara. Senjougahara is another character who does not approach the screen time she deserves and this small but sincere moment only reinforces how much we need more Senjogahara! Honestly, Araragi and Senjo are one of my all-time favorite couples in the anime, so it's really a shame that we do not see them together that often passed through Bakemonogatari. As with Part 1 of Owarimonogatari, Part 2 has some really surprising and surreal visuals, which, as always, I absolutely love. The Axis continues with all the quality and style of the animation, and they absolutely cemented their place as my favorite studio. Another area where I can not praise enough is, once again, the voice acting. All the usual Monogatari suspects are here including Hiroshi Kamiya, Maaya Sakamoto, Miyuki Sawashiro, Chiwa Saito and Satsuki Yukino, as well as new addition to the cast Rikiya Koyama as the voice of Shinobu's first minion, Seishirou, and they are all amazing as ever , Being the driving force behind this series mainly oriented to dialogue. We are also treated with our fourth (!) Opening in Owarimonogatari Part 2, ""mein schatz"" by meg rock, and while it's a pretty beautiful opening, I'm not very keen on the style of opera music, it's just not really mine Cup of tea. In short Despite a small number of flaws that are practically standard for Monogatari at this point, the final bow of Owarimonogatari has just solidified my love for this series, and neither can be one of the best entries in the Monogatari franchise.

Koi Kaze is probably one of the most intense anime that I have seen... ever. But this is based completely upon the subject matter of the series. The growing sense of &quot;do they or don't they&quot; that is created with each passing episode is possibly the only thing that actually kept me watching - despite the short 13 episode span. Ok, so first off - let's start at the beginning. The protagonist of the story, Koshiro, is a twenty-something man who works as a wedding planner. Due to his parents divorce several years earlier, his own love life seems to be rather tragic. At the time of the divorce, it was decided that Nanoka (his younger sister) would live with their mother, while Koshiro stayed with their father. Up to the beginning of the anime, neither sibling had seen each other since the separation. Meanwhile, the problems start when said younger sister moves in with her father and brother to save time on commuting to school. One one such trips they meet when Nanoka drops her travel pass. During the course of the day they meet again. When their father shows up they discover themselves to be siblings, and things escalate from there. The &quot;psychological&quot; tag for this anime is completely appropriate, because it really does play on your mind. The ides of incest will always remain a seriously taboo subject, but to see it happen in an anime is certainly an eye-opener. And seeing as this is my first anime which had this particular topic - it was even more of an eye-opener than usual. There's a lot of conflicting emotions also, Koshiro's need to protect his sister often clashes with his feelings of desire for her. This often causes his moods to fluctuate, something that initially confuses Nanoka. But then again, these are two people who have not seen each other in years - so, you can pretty much understand where this is coming from. I can't really say if I loved or loathed this particular anime. I'm pretty much somewhere in the middle with this one, but at the same time I'm actually quite glad that I have watched it, and I may even progress to read the manga.

I watched it every night for a week and finished it, honestly wishing it did not end. However, all great things must end sometimes. Well, on to the review. This time I will go through each section one-by-one for a truly thorough review: Story: Slice of life- need I say more? However, this anime actually surprised me with it's small back story and character stories. Since this is my second ever slice-o-life animes I have watched, I cannot say this for everyone, but for me it was different than others I have seen. Rather everyday life, where nothing really happens, you actually get to know each character (with very distinct personalities) and how they interact with one another. Some animes fail at this, while others do fantastic, and I think Inou-Battle did a fantastic job. The show surprisingly had me connect to the characters in ways I didn't know possible. (More on character later). But, like I said, the story is not huge at all, but what is there is great. Loved it. Art: Oh my goodness the art. The art in this show is down-right beautiful. From the faces and body movement, to the surroundings, this show delivers the goods. For me, the real selling point for art is the design of characters, how their mood changes based on physical attributes, and action movement. (Note: Blush is used A LOT during this anime. Not a bad thing, either). The blush is an example of the whole ""expression"" thing. Really makes it one of the selling points of the show. When the characters do stuff funny (for example, Tomoyo and her embarrassed mouth. Trust me, it's funny). That's not all, however, so look forward to some great art when watching this show. Stunning. Sound: For me personally, sound is not that important... Until there is an extremely important/dramatic scene taking place. When there is a moment like this, the sound really creates an amazing atmosphere. (Especially when it's sad). Also, the opening song: AMAZING. I had it stuck in my head for a while (kind-of still is haha) so yeah, the show does not disappoint! Character: Personally, I really liked these characters. Each has a distinct personality and interaction with one another, and are down-right hilarious!. It made me feel good, and it's hard to explain why. And I mean ""good"" in a sense of well-being and really touched me on a personal level. The design of the characters is awesome too. Each one has a clear distinction from the next. (So much that, when Tomoyo was disguised as someone else, I automatically knew it was her). For people who watched the show, the distinction factor is easy to see. As for interaction, this is when romance comes into play. For me, romance is not something that ""amazing"" to me, but it honestly fit the show perfectly. There was no ""kissy-kissy"" junk or any over-doing. It strives to bring a different kind of message. Not about loving others, but loving yourself and your friends. That's an awesome, and powerful message that I can, and many others can, relate to. So, for characters, 10, outstanding. Enjoyment: I think my review above can summarize this part itself! (In other words, I really liked it). Overall: If your looking for constant battles, this show is not your type. While there are usage of the super-powers in the show, the main focus behind the powers is much different than simple fantasy fiction: It acts like a bond to hold these friends together closer than they have been before. While powers don't exist in real life, you can make bonds with a group of friends that can last forever. It's a great feeling, and I can relate to it. Also, this story focuses on another topic: being who you are. Andou is chuunibyou, and plans to stay that way. He shows it very often, and really likes how he is the way he is: a trait many people, sadly, don't have. Now, this relates to me personally on many levels. Well, I don't know if I am chuunibyou or not, but I do like things other tend not to (But I'm not a hipster, I assure you. I don't go out of my way to be cool. I just be who I am and don't try to like something just because others do). Anyway the point is that I like, for example, to wear scarves a lot and nobody else does. So, what do I do? Don't care and wear them anyway, even though you are made fun of. That's how Andou, and somewhat Tomoyo, rolls, and that's how you should roll. So to end this review, I can say, without a doubt, 10/10 most definitely. (Yes, I know, perfect score). I recommend this to anyone who wants a good laugh, characters to relate to, and a great lesson in life to learn that can maybe change yours. Thanks for reading, and have a nice day.

236767,11771,Kuroko no Basket,"['Comedy', 'School', 'Shounen', 'Sports']",614684,89,240.0,5.0,"Are you looking for a sports anime that's coherent, realistic, and handles the sport it features properly? If yes, stay far away from Kuroko no Basket. On the other hand, if you are looking something that's flashy, cool, funny, and couldn't give any less of a shit about stuff like logic and plot execution, this anime is for you. Kuroko no Basket suffers from a very wide variety of problems. Depending on how much these problems bother you personally, your enjoyment of this anime will be affected from a bit to a lot. The pacing is bad, the plot progression is arbitrarily forced, the characters tend to be lackluster (with some exceptions), it is completely unrealistic but pretends it isn't, which is annoying, it is utterly incoherent, and finally, it makes no fucking sense. Despite everything mentioned above, I wouldn't say it's bad anime overall. Its main redeeming quality is that it is funny. When it tries to be funny, it usually succeeds. There are also occasions when it is unintentionally funny due to overflowing stupidity. How much you are going to enjoy this anime depends a lot on how much you think about it. The more you think about it, the more it falls apart. But if you are just looking for mindless entertainment, this is a good fit. There's no shame in that.

I first watched this in 2012 and thoroughly enjoyed it, but watching it again now, after having just finished rewatching season 1 has put me in kind of a bad mood. Now, the first time I watched Darker than Black, I couldn't find the dub for season 2 back in 2012, and so I've never watched it. But I have seen season 1 and Gaiden two times each at this point. And while I loved rewatching season 1, I feel like the story here falls short by a large margin. There are just too many breaks in continuity in the overarching story. In season 1, the premise is that the gates, the dolls, the contractors... everything appeared 10 years before the story started. By the end of it, we learn that the syndicate was created with the sole purpose of destroying all contractors and dolls. However, in this OVA, that is directly contradicted. Instead, we are told that the Syndicate was created fifty years before (so roughly 38? years before this OVA takes place). FIFTY YEARS! I mean come on. Somehow, someone made a prophecy that a doll (and it's not like anyone even knew what that was at that point) would ""awaken"" and become a reincarnation of one of the Japanese Shinto gods. And instead of tossing said prophesy in the trash, they created a multinational, multi-BILLION dollar organization with the sole purpose of stopping that from happening. Someone literally went, ""oh boy, the local fortune teller said that Izanami is going to be resurrected. Guess I better spend the next 50 years infiltrating every single world power in order to stop that. Yep, that's the plan!"" Oh, and those special particles that the syndicate was going to use to destroy all the contractors in the world? The ones that Hei erased from existence in order to choose the third option at the end of season 1, using his sister's power to change matter? And the fact that these particles were erased from existence being the ENTIRE REASON the syndicate fell apart (due to them no longer being able to erase all the contractors)? Yea, apparently they're back for some reason, and the doctor involved in the Saturn Gates is making devices that still use those particles. Like... what? Don't get me wrong, I love the parts of this that involve Hei and Yin. Think it's well done, and I definitely enjoyed it. Worth watching for that alone. But my experience was definitely soured by the complete and utter dismissal of the facts we learned about in season 1. I know this was made after season 2 and it's story is going to be constricted because of that. But maybe there shouldn't have *been* a season 2 if this was the direction they were going to take it. The parts between Yin evolving as a doll, and Hei and Yin's relationship progressing gets a solid 9/10 in enjoyment from me. The parts involving Yin turning into some out of control god, the syndicate apparently forming 40 years before the events of season 1, and every single organization in the world knowing that this was going to happen get a solid 2/10. So going to give this an , even though it objectively should get like a 4/10.

My major problem was the story-line. It was predictable. 1 - Vash rolls into town, destruction (best part) 2 - Introduce the sex appeal (she's useless throughout the movie, but she can beat up a couple nameless thugs pretty good) 3 - Introduce the Bad Guy, he has a strange philosophy where destruction and robbery fuel his massive ego 4 - Re-introduce the old mains, who rally to save everyone 5 - Vash rolls in to save everyone at the last second, because only he can. 6 - Sun glances off Vash's super cool glasses and he wakes away into the desert without water My problem with this story line is that it has been done over a million and a half times. There are no surprises in the entire movie (except for the part where Vash got shot, but we all knew he hadn't really died BECAUSE HE'S THE MAIN CHARACTER). I fail to see any creativity in this old re-used excuse to bring back fan-favourites. Here is what I wanted: 1 - If you're going to introduce sex-appeal, then let there be sex. Otherwise, give them a use. Give them a personality. Give them something to make me feel like they are a real person and have something to contribute to the story. (Amelie was, admittedly the daughter of the bad guy, but whatever. That's not enough for me :/ ) 2 - Everyone has flaws, except the characters I see in anime/movies/books. Fictional characters seem to have fallen into a cookie-cut staple where they are basic and boring. When was the last time you saw someone seriously fuck up, or kill the bad guy out of rage, or shoot a bullet that missed and ended up killing an innocent, or something I can't foresee. 3 - It seems to me that anime's choose to be realistic whenever it serves to aid the plot. Example, Vash never misses a shot, except when its the final bad guy of the movie. A weak example, but I feel if you're going to introduce realism to an anime, you need to keep it consistent throughout the entire thing. You can't use it as a plot device, because it cheats the entire story(side note: I hate plot devices, they are boring). FINAL THOUGHTS: I wanted more from this. I LOVED the original Trigun series, (I especially loved looking for that blasted black cat who was always hiding somewhere in the background of every episode, one of my favorite flavor-pieces of any anime ever). But I found nothing new or interesting in this story. It was nice to see Vash again, but I would have preferred that his memory was preserved in memory rather than tarnished by something new, and dull.

Well I just finished watching ""Ousama Game, The Animation"". I don't really know how I feel now that it's over, Just when you think the show can't get any more stupid, it somehow manages to do just that. There are so many unanswered questions, What exactly is the King's game? Who is the king? Why was this show made? Why am I watching it? And why is there a second season coming out?? The show was structured very poorly. As I previously touched on, Flashbacks are a big part of this show, and i'm talking about 60% of the first half of the series takes place in a flashback. They obviously had a lot of things that they wanted to cover, so why they didn't focus on the MC's first King's game only is beyond me, especially as there's going to be a season 2. The actual plot itself isn't awful, I like the idea of it, however I feel it was poorly done in practice. It really did feel like an edgy Mirai Nikki clone more times than it should have. The art was very dull to look at and overall looked about 10 years older than it is, there were some truly awful looking effects and some glaring inaccuracies. For example. a character trips on a tree root as she is running forward, then suddenly there is a cliff edge and she falls down it, facing backwards... The sound was nothing special either. The only thing of note is the Opening theme, which I did enjoy. Everything else was just forgettable, not terrible, but nothing to write home about either. And now for my biggest problem with this show; the characters. Never have I watched a show where I've thought that most, if not all the characters were complete morons. but Ousama game changed that. We have our male lead, Nobuaki, he's about as cookie cutter as you can get, and he only seems to have two characteristics, he's either trying to save everybody, or he's crying, because he can't save everybody. The only character I really liked was the main female Antagonist, but I even began to find her insufferable as the episodes went on. This next paragraph contains some minor spoilers, so skip if you want to stay unspoiled: My issue with the characters, and by extension, the writing, is never more evident than in one particular scene. A friend of Nobuaki has been sentenced to death via suicide by midnight. so Nobuaki and a friend decide to stay with him all night to make sure he doesn't kill himself. The scene was actually quite good at first, with them playing music together and having a good time, It gets to midnight, and they're all relieved that he's still alive. He then basically goes ""right i'm off to get a drink"" and the others are perfectly fine with this, which already had me questioning the writing. and sure enough, Nobuaki's phone was 5 minutes off, it's not midnight yet! sure enough, the character in question was shortly found hanging. It's scenes like this which make the show laughable. things seem to happen only because they're necessary to the plot, with no rhyme or reason. I have so many questions about the show that weren't answered in the first season of this show. and I have to ask myself, do I care enough to watch season 2 whenever that may start airing? The answer is yes, surprisingly, I by no means thought that the show was good, but for some reason I couldn't bring myself to drop it, even after 6 episodes of flashbacks and stupidity. I often found myself laughing at the show for the wrong reasons, and I was genuinely curious to see if it could get any more ridiculous as the show progressed. And for that, I have to give it a couple of points. I give Ousama game; the Animation a 3/10. Watch this show if you're looking for something to laugh at, or if you really, really like survival anime and haven't seen this yet. Alternatively, you can do what I'm about to go and do, and watch Mirai Nikki Instead.

250674,19,Monster,"['Drama', 'Horror', 'Mystery', 'Police', 'Psychological', 'Seinen', 'Thriller']",459710,159,46.0,6.0,"- Summary (TL:DR) - The show started strong and slowly meanders its way to the finish line. The characters were very much defined from the get go and changes very little throughout the story. personally, I didn't find as deep and complex as the fans of the show claimed it to be, but I didn't find it to be as much of a snooze fest as it's haters claimed. So what do I think about Naoki Urasawa's Monster? Ehh, it's fine, I don't find it particularly offensive but I doubt I would be recommending it to anyone. If you're thinking of watching the show, watch the first 4 episodes, and then continue watching but thinking of the episodes after episode 4 as its own separate series. - Story - I remembered when I had first seen the first few episodes of the show, it was perhaps the most compelling first episodes I had ever seen in all my years of watching anime. I began recommending this series left and right. I thought to myself ""could this be the one? Had I found the one true masterpiece? Is there where my anime watching career will end?"" No. Unfortunately, it was not to be. As I continued forwards through the 72 episodes, never again did the series ever grab me as much as it did in the first few episodes. The story began to drag on, the mysteries became obvious, disposable side characters were introduced and all the tension that had been built up through the first few episodes has vanished by the half way point. While the story still remained complex, it was not for the reasons one might hope as the plot began to tangle around bland uninteresting side characters forming arcs which barely connected to the main storyline. The beginnings and ends of each arc were very obvious and disjointed which isn't necessarily a negative, but the conclusion of every ""filler arc"" did serve to remind me of just how much of my time that this show has wasted. There was no reason (apart from the manga source material) that this show could not have been half its length. As for the end, I will not spoil it. I will, however, say it was obvious that Urasawa had planned this ending from the very beginning as the ending reflected an ongoing theme within the show. But by the time we got to the there, I felt that the theme in question had already been reinforced soo many times throughout, that by the time we arrived at the ending, it had no real impact. - Art & Sound - I found both the art and sound to be serviceable, it didn't add anything to the show but it also did not detract from it. It fitted nicely with the mood and atmosphere the show was trying to achieve. - Characters - The characters were by far the weakest point of the series, while not your traditional archetypes, the characters lacked complexity and dimensions. The main characters were defined very early and received very little development despite the long runtime. Take Dr Tenma for example, our protagonist, you'd think with 74 episodes mostly following one man's journey of redemption, that we'd at least see multi-facets of that characters but nope, Dr Gary Stu can do no wrong, not only does he never doubt his actions, he is infallible, omnibenevolent and to top it off, his hands had healing abilities which would have made Jesus jealous. (I totally forgot to mention Nina, AKA female Tenma) As previously mentioned, as the story dragged on, many shallow side-characters were introduced, all with their own problems for Dr Tenma to solve. In fact, most of the main characters in the show could be summarised in one short sentence. I will refrain from making examples as I do believe the first few episodes are very much worth your time. The characters in Monster lacked humanity, making them appear robotic and soulless. Which would explain why the most compelling character by far is the main antagonist of the story, but as the story dragged on. even he became more and more like a force of nature character, rather than a true character. It's as if Urasawa had written the plot points rather than characters.

User: The animation is stunning, the soundtrack is breathtaking, and the story is engaging. However, the pacing is slow and some plot points feel rushed. Overall, it's a great watch, but it could have been even better with a tighter script.

The show in question is Usagi-chan de Cue!!, a moderately bad to horrible ecchi anime that combines the anime staples of shounen fighting, harems, and impossible breasts all topped with a pair of bunny ears. The plot is ridiculous and silly, even by anime standards. Nor does it really make any sense either. It’s not that this really matters, because clearly what it is about is gigantic tits, tank tops and low angle panty shots. Though I was not going into this expecting a deep storyline but everything that is presented is completely nonsensical and a bit disturbing. What you might be able to decipher from it though is that a secret organization is making human-animal hybrids for unknown purposes. I think. Or maybe they are just spontaneously happening on their own, apparently because they are lonely. I get lonely too sometimes. Does this mean I am going to wake up one morning with rabbit years and a fluffy tail? And now, on to our hero and heroines. Every good harem anime (and bad one too) needs a dull, lifeless, loser hero to attract his covey of buxom babes. Haru fills this role, as the animal loving guy who must fend off his slutty harem from making him see their enormous tits or trying to sleep with him. I mean what kind of teenager would want that!? Mikami/Mimika and Miku star as the chief threats to his virginal ways. Mikami is a violent girl but when merged with the rabbit she becomes a completely different type as the moe affectionate stupid girl Mimika. The story manages to delve into Mikami's sad and tragic past but there is little emotional meat behind any of it. The most unbelievable part about Mikami is her total and complete lack of any reaction to becoming half rabbit. I mean really? Hello? You have bunny ears and a tail! This doesn't freak your out even a little bit? She basically just treats it like its always been that way. On the other hand, Miku is our long suffering childhood friend who has always loved the male lead but doesn’t have the courage to say so. Yawn... where have I seen this before? Oh yeah, everywhere! The supporting cast exists mostly for laughs. The villains are shadowy and lack any substance to make them hated or to even understand their motives. Of all of them Chou, the dog boy is probably the most amusing character in the series. The running gag with his changing headband was worth a few chuckles. Artistically this show is really not appealing at all. If your desire is to see breasts and up skirt shots there are other anime that do it far better than this one. The breasts in particular are absurd looking and I have to honestly wonder if the artist behind these designs has ever even seen a real woman naked before. The action and fighting scenes are not compelling either. I suppose the music track and acting would constitute the high point of this series but that is giving it too much credit. They are average at best though some of the character voices are annoying to listen to. Mimika's performance in particular is increasingly irritating and grates on ones nerves as the show progresses. Even hard core fans of ecchi and bunny ears would be hard pressed to find anything remarkable about Usagi-chan. If you really want to watch girls fighting you would be better off with something like Ikkitousen or Sekirei.

One thing I will be rating ANIME so I won't be comparing how well it represent LN or manga. Oh yeah one more thing I've seen some people b*tching about one specific thing and that is sex. So let's make it quick this is ECCHI not hentai, Ecchi never goes to "" real sex"" it is mainly teasing. If you wanna see people f*cking, go watch some hentai or porn. Writer hentai thoughs about above: Shame it's Ecchi though, in later LN volumes it gets quite lit on sexual side, wouldn't really mind a sequel. \\ spoiler alert just in case // Art: 7/10 Overall I think artstyle is decent, our protagonists gear look good, enemies looks well, so not much problem here. Characters: 6/10 Even though our MC doesn't really has any personal traits that would make him my favorite character. Other characters compensate it quite well. They have some really interesting backstories, so they aren't just members of our MC harem without any backstory or personality so that's nice. One thing that is dissapointing is that except of our MC there isn't any other male character. Character progression: 8/10 For an Ecchi there is solid development. We see our characters overcoming their fears, facing their past, exploring their origin so really good job. Story: 7/10 Gates to the other world appeared on earth and alien ( robot) invaders appeared and bringed human race to almost extinction. Our MC has a unique ability to replenish energy of special gears that can be used by woman only, by doing intimate acts with them. Season 1 is mostly about fighting invaders and improval of our MC ability. Story progression: 8/10 Story goes fairy fluent, it is mostly focused on main story with some side addition. Villains: 4/10 Gravel: 5/10 General from the other world, she attacked our protagonists base and single handedly defeated many soldiers, she is aiming for our "" main heroine"" in order to bring her to their world. We get to see that she has a romantic relationship with her subordinate Aldea, but she has no real backstory showned except of being general from empire that lost to Vatlantis empire. Zelshione: 4/10 She is higher up of Vatlantis empire. She is shown as a sadistic person, she doesn't really has any backstory, she is "" final boss"" in anime and is defeated by our MC. Girls: 8/10 If we ever get season 2 I think it can score 9. We have really good variety: Red hair, black hair, ashen hair, blond hair, brown hair, green gair. Mostly big boobs, even bigger boobs, some medium size and small size. small butts, medium butts, big butts. Sound: 8/10 HxH has some nice soundtracks and melodies so no problem here. So overall rating of Masou Gakuen HxH is 7/10 exact. Many people comes to Ecchi and whines about story logic intimate scenes logic etc. They are making Ecchi something that it isn't. Ecchi is mostly about teasing and some nudity, this anime takes it to higher level and closer to hentai, but stays away from that category.

278841,28851,Koe no Katachi,"['Drama', 'School', 'Shounen']",842277,53,10.0,5.0,"Overview: A Silent Voice is a VERY popular anime and I can see its appeal. This is an anime that is beautifully animated by the much beloved Studio Kyoto. It has a soundtrack featuring The Who! It promised to actually address the issue of bullying far better than previous anime and give it the serious look it deserves. It promised to be a beautiful redemption tale and love story all in one. This anime SHOULD have been amazing. Sadly, I was really not a fan of this film and was badly disappointed to say the least. I'm not trolling. I'm not being contrarian for the lulz. I'm quite serious and I'll explain why. Warning! There will be some spoilers! Bullying and its portrayal in anime: Before discussing the technical things like art and music, I really need to cover this topic. Bullying is a real world issue that effects millions of people around the world and contributes to suicide, depression, eating disorders, etc. Unfortunately, anime has a long and generally horrendous history in terms of tackling this topic. Bullies in anime tend to be like bullies in a Stephen King novel. They tend to be 1 dimensional bastards that exist solely to torment our heroes and eventually get their grisly comeuppance. When I heard about an anime that would finally give this topic the respect it deserved, I was thrilled! Finally an anime could help redeem over 40 years of the medium doing it wrong. Here are some reasons I feel this film fell short. A deaf girl named Shouko transfers into a 6th grade class and immediately the whole class start tormenting her and treating her like shit. Our MC Shouya repeatedly yanks out her hearing aids and destroys them in front of everyone. He does this EIGHT TIMES in 5 months and even makes her bleed out of her ears. The teacher just ignores this abuse until Shouko's mother complains. The teacher then singles out Shouya and only Shouya to be the fall guy. Does he get expelled? Suspended? Detention? Nope. His mother is told and she scolds him. Shouya doesn't take his loving mother's lesson to heart and physically assaults Shouko. The school STILL doesn't do anything against Shouya. Kid doesn't even get detention. I know Japan is a different culture than America, but WTF?! This all seems absurdly contrived. Firstly, this would be far more believable if it was a Kindergarten class and not fucking 6th graders. Kindergarten kids have no established morals and really will bully kids in overt ways for being different. I still remember when a little Asian girl transferred into my all White kindergarten in Indiana. We all did ""Asian Eyes"". We all called her names. One kid started doing monkey chants, so we all started doing monkey chants. It was fucked up and I STILL feel bad about it now that I'm 30. By the the 6th grade, kids are FAR less likely to universally bully a kid for being a little different and the ways in which they bully are different. By the 6th grade, kids will bully by not talking to an unpopular kid, shunning them, and maybe attacking them on social media. A whole 6th grade class being supportive of physically beating up a little deaf girl and making her bleed from the ears is pretty damn unlikely to say the least. Secondly, a character needs to do horrible things in order to set up a redemption tale. However, we are typically given a REASON why the character begins the story that way. This reason doesn't justify their actions, but it makes the audience understand the hero and what is going through their mind. Let's take a break from anime and look at another popular redemption movie, American History X. So why did Derek become a Neo-Nazi? He was raised by a father who was pretty racist and instilled a bit of that in him at a young age. Derek's father was murdered in a high crime Black neighborhood. Derek angrily blamed minorities for his father's murder and looked for groups to channel his anger. He ended up finding one of the many racist groups that exist in America both online and off, which reinforced his beliefs and helped mold him into the character we see at the beginning. Shouya on the other hand, is an absolute monster towards the handicapped for no reason. He comes from a loving, middle class family. He isn't a natural born sociopath. He isn't the least popular kid in school and desperate to make 1 person beneath him on the totem pole. He isn't being persuaded by some warped ideology that encourages bullying the handicapped in order to transcend traditional morality and prove himself an Ubermensch. He goes way farther than anyone else in his class and at no point are we EVER given a modicum of why or what he's thinking. Shouya begins the story a complete monster for no other reason than to set up a redemption tale. Ok, so they fucked up a little. At least Silent Voice still tackles bullying WAY better than other anime...right? Honestly, no it doesn't. Let's set the bar really low and see how A Silent Voice compared to Elfen Lied, an anime that is widely agreed to have done a poor job tackling the issue. The main bully in Elfen Lied is a little brat named Tomoo. This kid is a 10 year old orphan being raised at a chronically underfunded and neglectful orphanage. Nobody is showing kindness to him, so he torments others in order raise himself up. At least we can understand Tomoo and his motivations, so point 1 goes to EL. Now let's look at their targets. Shouko is hard of hearing, but is otherwise an ordinary little girl. She is extremely cheerful and extroverted. No matter how much she is bullied, she forgives with saintlike compassion and tries to befriend Shouya, who just laughs at her and beats her up more. Lucy has red eyes and demonic horns. She objectively looks like a freak within her own anime. Prior to snapping, Lucy responds to bullying with the same cold, disdainful glare. Lucy doesn't try to befriend Tomoo. Her defiant attitude, difficulty showing emotions, and introverted personality all end up contributing to further bullying, which is accurate to real life. Point 2 goes to EL. Now lets look at how over the top the bullying was. The worst thing Tomoo did was beat Lucy's dog to death. Now in America, we value dogs at almost the level we value humans. Killing a dog is an unforgivable act of villainy. In most of the world, constantly ripping out the hearing aids of a little deaf girl, destroying them, and beating her up over a period of 5 months for no reason is far worse than killing 1 dog. Shouya's unbelievable, over the top cruelty exceeds any action taken by Tomoo. Point 3 goes to Elfen Lied. Congratulations Silent Voice! You just got owned by fucking Elfen Lied. You overrated piece of horse shit! Plot and characters: After 30 minutes of our MC being the biggest douche in anime that is NOT Dio Brando, we flash forward to high school. The entire class immediately switched from bullying Shouko to bullying Shouya. I guess they have exactly 1 target at a time. Now Shouya is a good guy and wants to make things up to Shouko. We of course already know Shouko is the most forgiving character that isn't supposed to be a Christ character or represent the very best of humanity, so our only real obstacle is another girl from their 6th grade class named Naoka. We see that Naoka still HATES Shouko and is an absurdly evil bitch because she blames Shouko for Shouya being bullied...even though she herself helped bully Shouya. In the manga, Naoka has her own redemption arc in parallel to Shouya's and ends up really developing as a character. In the movie, they had to cut that out and she's just an evil bitch that adds NOTHING to this story. She isn't even the antagonist of this tale. An antagonist actually ADDS something to the plot! I'm not going to spoil the whole ending, but I found its sentimentality to be utterly ineffectual. We also can't have an effective romance because that requires TWO likeable characters. The only character with any development and depth deeper than a rain puddle is Shouya. It's like the film writer honestly didn't give a shit about anyone else. Art: Yes, the art is pretty and cute and Studio Kyoto is awesome. The X's over characters' faces when they are rejecting Shouya was a cool touch. I don't have anything to criticize here. It was good, but not good enough to save this from being a mess. Music: Well...at least we got 1 song by the Who. That's more than most anime. Overall: I really wanted to love this anime like everyone else apparently does. This was honestly one of the more disappointing anime experiences I've had in a long time. The characters besides 1 are badly underdeveloped. The plot is a contrived mess that utterly fails at tackling bullying better than past anime. The romance is lackluster and I got very few genuine feels out of this one. The art and production values are spectacular. The premise on paper is great. Then it all seems to fall apart. Kind of like Joker Game in that regard, which I won't bother reviewing because I just basically did. I'm not going to warn people away and scream to ""Not buy the hype"". Maybe someone else will have a different experience and really enjoy this film. This was just my experience and my own thoughts. I hope Your Name ends up being better than this!

60467,5081,Bakemonogatari,"['Romance', 'Supernatural', 'Mystery', 'Vampire']",834574,51,189.0,10.0,"The anime follows Koyomi Araragi as he saves different girls from demons with the help of Meme Oshino, a homeless middle aged man, and develops a kind of harem on the way. The story of each girl is told in 3 or 4 episodes. What makes this anime so good is the characters and the dialogue especially between Araragi and, the first girl he saves and the queen of tsundere, Hitagi Senjōgahara. Hitagi becomes the romantic interest for Araragi after he saves her but unlike most tsundere in anime she doesn't become all venerable instead she shows herself to be a strong and intelligent character who is more than his equal.l She becomes Araragi's girlfriend because she wants to be with him not because she depends on him which is usually the case in anime. It has to be said I have a weakness for any female character in anime which challenges and makes the main male protagonist suffer forcing them to be a man. It has to be said the dialogue between all the characters is excellent. It is fast and intelligent and just when you begin to follow it the dialogue goes off in a tangent throwing you and Araragi off balance. I wouldn't say any of the characters are unlikable and each one has a story although Tsubasa Hanekawa is a little boring. The animation is very original and focuses mainly on where the characters are so there isn't any unnecessary detail. I wouldn't say the story is anything original although there are some nice twists and there are a lot of puns which means if your not Japanese you will miss most of the humour. This isn't my best review but if you enjoy anime with intelligent dialogue this is one for you.

Prefer/interested in a generally apathetic MC? Into/loving the idea of an antagonist that's like that one especially difficult Dark Souls boss but with the ability to almost instantly revive? AJIN is here for you! [Warning: halfway through this season, AJIN diverges from the original manga, but remarkably it doesn't hurt the show very much. The manga's a real good read, you should try it.] OVERALL - rounded up 8.5 I feel bad typing this, but modern-day stories about terrorism always fascinates me (I'm looking at you, beautifully animated Zankyō no Terror! >_>). AJIN explores a world where immortality is coveted for its research advantages, and this darker view of the esteemed trait is something that'll tickle your grim fancies for a good bit. Not for the squeamish. Seriously. It's not the blood that gets to you---it's the constant possibility of decapitation. STORY - rounded up 8.5 AJIN, expectedly, shifted its focus to Satou vs. Nagai Kei from the original intrigue of immortals being used for experimentation pretty quickly (aka season 1). This interesting concept drew me in; yet it was the psychological intensity of fighting against an OP, crazy, immortal ex-soldier with an addiction to games and an affection for his hat that kept me here* *I say that, but tbh it's because of my affection for Nagai Kei (MC) and for just how much Miyano Mamoru's voice suits the character. ART/ANIMATION - rounded up 8.5 The awkward CG, like the dark, takes awhile for your eyes to adjust to. Yet I feel as if AJIN is an anime that could not have been done better any other way. There's something here that makes me think: ""I wouldn't watch this if it was the usual 2D."" Perhaps it's Satou-san's fast-paced, eye-widening murder sprees? Or perhaps it's the hilarious fluidity of Kei's jaded/irritated facial expressions? ^-^' SOUND/MUSIC - rounded down 7.5 There's only a few stand out tracks because they are used repeatedly to signal increasing TENSION! or CHAOS!! or HYPE!!! Perhaps AJIN conditions you to prepare for a certain thrill when you hear the beginnings of a certain track? Remarkably, this actually rather works. CHARACTERS - 8 I'll be honest. This'd be pretty damn crappy if it weren't for the strongly-written protagonist and antagonist: Nagai Kei and Satou-san. They carry this anime so much that they are pointed to as why many people follow this series. ENJOYMENT - 9 There are some things contained in the manga that I truly wished should've made its way in the anime *cough Hirasawa cough* even though its story diverged *cough ""like watching my sons"" cough cough.* These things primarily had to do with developing Kei's character and his ""lack"" of emotions---it's more dynamic than that; I can write a whole dissertation on it---which I think is one of AJIN's best aspects. Regardless, this is a thrilling and bloody show that's terrifyingly amazing at making a marvel of the destruction an immortal madman can achieve.

212057,3002,Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor,"['Game', 'Psychological', 'Thriller', 'Seinen']",192202,562,230.0,7.0,"The sibling franchise to _Akagi_. _Kaiji_ follows a fairly standardized beat: Kaiji lazes around until catastrophe befalls him; to get out of it, he participates in a gambling game, is naive & trusting, plunges further into disaster, wakes up and (often with the trust & assistance of some even bigger losers than him) comes up with an ingenious trick or stratagem to win back all his losses and then some; and then he falls right back asleep and since he's a gambling addict/loser, he'll eventually lose most or all of it again, to repeat the cycle... Structurally, it's the opposite of _Akagi_ (even though there are some _Akagi_ references in it), because Akagi is the inscrutable gambler par excellance, who coldly weighs every odd and plans every move on multiple levels - like the 'security mindset' of a good hacker, this is not something one turns off, and we cannot imagine Akagi ever co-signing a loan nor lazing around nor cheating nor can we imagine him ever falling for, say, a 'friendly' game of cee-lo without taking gambler's ruin (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler's_ruin) into account nor could he be said to be addicted, because he's always in control; but also Akagi only ever plays one game, mahjong, while Kaiji plays a different game every time. Not being a mahjong player, _Akagi_ was almost entirely lost on me, while the games in _Kaiji_ are clearly explained and often simple. Some of the invented games are quite interesting: Restricted Rock-Paper-Scissors layers a mini-economy onto rock-paper-scissors to produce complexities I'd love to see investigated more deeply, while E-Card is simple yet exemplifies what game designer Sirlin calls ""yomi"" (http://www.sirlin.net/ptw-book/7-spies-of-the-mind). The art is about the same as far as I can recall: no women anywhere (which makes one wonder if that's misogynistic or not: does he think that women don't matter, are too sensible to fall into these traps, or that men will always sacrifice themselves?), and characters with heavily stylized faces and noses so sharp that a losing character could commit seppuku with them; I can't decide if I love or hate it. The narrator, once you get used to the purple prose, is hilarious (at one point I noted that the narration could be used in a pornographic film with little or no editing.) The music takes a punk rock approach, echoing one of the major themes: that society is structurally unfair, filled with traps and deceptions and false promises of rewards to encourage people to trample on each other and throw away their time/lives to win position & wealth from the meritocracy, becoming 'slaves to those above, and tyrants to those below' only to eventually be fed into the maw of the system by their successor and discarded when their usefulness is over; those who win are not those who are lucky but those who have seen through the lies fed to the ordinary people and realized that you must cheat, deceive, and steal your way to the top - when the Chairman talks about a ""king's luck"", it is merely an euphemism for cheating (so in other words, 'kings' *make* their own 'luck'), and those who refuse to cheat but entrust their hopes to chance or God will eventually lose and will deserve to have lost, and indeed, failure to understand this is Kaiji's ultimate undoing at the end of season 1. (The critique is generically Marxist, complete with obese capitalist plutocrats savoring the suffering of the lumpen-proletariat.) So that's the stew of ingredients which is _Kaiji_: a loser with a heart of gold and occasional flashes of genius who is too weak-willed and soft-hearted to escape his permanent cycle of debt-hell and is plunged into exotic games for the amusement of the wealthy where he must scheme & cheat for his salvation. Is it successful? I would say no. The character himself is too implausible to take seriously (again, we may not like Akagi or see any depth to his character, but he is like a shark: his eyes are flat and reveal no consciousness inside but he is perfectly adapted to his environment). The art remains a problem since we're going to be staring at Kaiji's face for a very long time. Solutions to the gambles are not always satisfactory, as Fukamoto is better at inventing games than solving them, so the resolutions often involve some overly convenient devices like some valuable jewels just feet away Kaiji can grab to save himself or cheating. (Season 2 in particular is a huge letdown in this respect.) Some of the twists make no sense: how is a man blown to his death from a window opening on the 22nd story? That is... not actually all that high up! And at the end of season 1, how can we possibly believe that it could end that way when one of the 3 special rules was very visibly broken and so Kaiji didn't actually lose? (Since the folding of the ballot was clearly depicted in the animation, and folding was explicitly forbidden by the Chairman as a rule, I was convinced that Kaiji would point this out and snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, leading to my single greatest surprise in watching _Kaiji_.) The cheating in E-card made no sense: if a billionaire wants to cheat at his own card game at a time & place of his own choosing with his own custom cards in his own custom game room, there are approximately an infinite number of ways to cheat which don't involve elaborate electronic gadgets attached to someone, and heck, the cheating wasn't even necessary, since the entire arc would have worked just fine if Toneagawa had good tell-reading skills and Kaiji had to use desperate measures to defeat the reading! (Tonegawa was probably my favorite character, and I was disappointed to see him made to resort to such clumsy cheating.) The pacing of both seasons is atrocious, as episodes are grossly stretched out: season 1's Restricted Rock-Paper-Scissors was too long, the Human Derby & death bridge were much too long, and the E-card / lottery games were somewhat too long; while season 2, with only 2 games in it (cee-lo and the pachinko machine) should have been done as maybe 9 episodes at the most (with zero loss) and I strongly advise watching at 300% speed if you watch season 2. (I wonder if the manga suffers from the pacing problem? I suspect probably not.) The pachinko machine arc is - let's not mince words here - pretty stupid, especially when you start season 2 with the understandable expectation that Kaiji has learned his lesson and will meet the Chairman again in an even more epic duel. (He hasn't, and won't.)

It's an omake, of course there's not gonna be a whole lot of action and excitement in it. I think Road to Hero is an awesome OVA. We get to a little bit of Saitama before he became the strongest man in the universe (presumably). There's not much back story on Saitama in the original series so seeing him interact with another person before he became this overpowered hero is a nice little bonus. We get to see how his iconic yellow jump suit came to be. The humor was still there, it's one of the main reason why I loved the show. It's a fuck it show on overpowered beings but it's so filled with great humor you'll forget that there isn't real that much plot in the series. The old man was so sweet. I can't help but wonder what happened to him or where he is now that Saitama is a licensed hero. Finally, it made me want to see more of the show. I want more One Punch!

Ok, here is the review : When I see this for the first time, I was thinking about Asterisk and Failed Knight because they have a similar intro, but I don't really mind it. But after completed this anime, I was very disappointed. Many things came up and make this anime more worse, fot example the last battle was good actually, but some things came and almost make me stopped watching fot a while, but I finally managed to watch it until end. For the story, it's bad. It's really bad. I can't tell how bad it was by word. Our mc, have a divine drag ride and supposed to be a strong character, in the last battle I think he would use all of his power, but no. His power were useless, well not completely useless but it's useless. That's same with other characters, nobody used their power to the max, that's make me it worse. Beside, the story is pretty hard to understand but I don't really paying attention into it. Intro and ending were good, the songs were nice, it also easy to remember. The voice act is awesome, I like it. The sound effect is great, No complaint from me, but overall I don't really like it because some background songs weren't fit with the show. But that's okay, I don't mind it. Overall it's an average show for me, because it have bad side and good side. I recommend this to you if you here only for the harem genre (it's not contain alot of ecchi). But if you looking for a good battle or something other than harem, you wouldn't be like this. The ending is a cliffhanger (this is an announcement, I won't tell you why did I wrote it) and I think it would be good if this has a second season.

183761,23199,Durarara!!x2 Shou,"['Action', 'Mystery', 'Supernatural']",319956,305,465.0,8.0,"It's been five years. I've been ready, you've been ready, everyone's been ready. It's been five years, but only now are we finally making that return trip to Ikebukuro. Question is, is it still as fresh and special as it was the first time around? The answer is no. Strangely enough, however, I wasn't exactly disappointed. 2010's Durarara!! is pretty much my favourite anime of all time, so expectations for its long-overdue return were, to say the least, pretty gosh darn high. To put it briefly, x2 Shou is not as good as the original. The huge cast of characters returns (but not all of them are given stuff to do), and it's added to with just about every passing episode. A common problem with big casts is that they're often poorly managed, and Shou is absolutely no exception to that. The worst example of this has to be Ruri Hijiribe, who shows up for a brief storyline in the first few episodes, only to never be seen again afterwards. Ruri's story ends up seeming completely pointless in the grand scheme of things, as do a lot of things and characters brought up this season. Shou seems to be mostly focused on buildup and introductions, which is both a good and a bad thing. Later arcs are where shit seriously starts to go down, and Shou lays down the groundwork for those. However, by the end of Shou, we are 36 episodes into the Durarara series. That should be waaaaaaaay past the buildup period. There's no shortage of things happening in Shou, but nothing is given a satisfying conclusion, since we're still in buildup mode. As a result, the whole season feels like it doesn't really matter. Many important characters also spend these 12 episodes not really doing much of anything, which gives the whole production a feeling of complacency. In terms of story, this is not a big ""welcome back"" after five long years of wait. The show actually tells us as much in its opening minutes. We're assured that not much is going to change. And it doesn't. Not yet, anyway. Shou fulfils its purpose as a buildup season just fine, but the problem is that it doesn't make for a compelling story of its own. There's a few great new additions, such as the fabulous Vorona, but the show's considerable faults can't all be carried on her petite Russian shoulders. Despite all of this, I can't say I was especially disappointed with Shou. Maybe I was overcome with such nostalgic glee that I was more than ready to look past its flaws, but I ended up enjoying the season more than a fair bit. Was the five year wait worth it? That remains to be seen. All in all, it's just good to have Durarara back. Also, the animation got worse.

214731,31859,Hai to Gensou no Grimgar,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Drama', 'Fantasy']",442214,173,955.0,7.0,"There are very minor spoilers in this review! Time and time again this hackneyed and overused plot line of mysteriously waking up in a RPG-esque world has been horribly developed and elaborated on. One dimensional characters, unrealistically dense MC's, and zero tension or atmosphere. Grimgar however, is able to take this concept and expand on it, utilizing its slow pace to build up a well fleshed out story. Story - 7 Grimgar gives you your typical high fantasy world with some amnesiacs thrown into the mix. Our main group of ""adventurers"" wake up in an unfamiliar environment where they must slay monsters and provide for themselves, all the while dealing with their own various issues. Grimgar does an exceptional job at creating a tense mood that reflects the situation they are in. The slow pace of the story also matches this, allowing the anime to slowly ease you in to the story. The reoccurring theme throughout the series provides a simple example of the volatility of the butterfly effect. Even the tiniest changes can have catastrophic repercussions, such as death or even something worse. Now here are some parts where Grimgar falls short of an adequate mark. A lot of the time, parts of the story tended to dabble on certain things for too long and melodrama ran amok in certain scenes. This former may be due to Grimgar's sluggish pacing, but that's all of course to personal preference depending on whether or not you are irked by slow anime. However, the latter is simply because of overly exaggerated scenes. While some instances the event is realistically reacted upon, other times it seems unnecessarily magnified. Art and Sound - 9 respectively A-1 Pictures has created beautiful and gorgeousl character models as expected of them. They are all equally on par and arguably even better than their past works. The sound track of Grimgar gives off a soothing tone and can be compared to that little cherry on top of your ice cream sundae. I think I should also mention the opening of Grimgar by (K) NoW_NAME. It's absolutely stunning. The first few seconds of it really just resonates with something within you. Kudos to them for putting out this superb song. Characters - 8 I think this is the area that Grimgar excels most in. The way each character has their distinct flaws and strengths gives them a very much ""real"" appearance. There are no Gary Stu's or Marty Stu's and the way the characters change from events does have a huge impact on them as a whole. An example of this is when Haruhiro is put up to the pedestal to lead the party. He struggles to cope with his new role and constantly beats himself up because he thinks of himself as incompetent for the role. While the characters independently are quite impressive themselves, the relationships between the characters elevate this even further. Even if it seemed the characters couldn't care less about one another at the beginning of Grimgar, over time they developed a care and understanding for each other. They leaped over hurdles together as they embraced the mad world that they have stumbled into. Personal Enjoyment - 7 While Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is no masterpiece, it certainly places itself above the mediocre of mediocre. It was pleasant to see each of the characters grow and change as I followed their progression through the anime. Even if the anime grew monotonous at certain points, it redeemed itself through its wonderful cast. Overall: 7 Helpful",3453,Positive,Positive,"Grimgar utilizes slow pace to build a well-fleshed story, but falls short in character development and some plot aspects.","{""sentiment"":""Positive"",""summary"":""Grimgar utilizes slow pace to build a well-fleshed story, but falls short in character development and some plot aspects.""}"
1353,2559,Romeo no Aoi Sora,"['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Historical', 'Slice of Life']",29345,2597,254.0,9.0,"Romeo no Aoi Sora is one of the last World Masterpiece Theater anime that was made before their nearly ten-year hiatus. WMT fans already know what that means about the series, non-fans should be told that it already tells us three things: 1. It is based on a foreign book for a young audience, this one from Switzerland; 2. It may be considered old in modern otaku terms but has aged well; 3. It's awesome. Like most of these types of anime, Romeo no Aoi Sora begins with a tragedy. In this case, Romeo, an 11-year-old boy, leaves his small village with the God of Death, a frightful man who buys children to sell as chimney sweeps in the city, in order to support his family. Soon, Romeo meets Alfredo, another chimney sweep who will become his best friend, as well as many other boys who share the same fate as him. As the series goes on, Romeo adjusts to his new life, including a family that is not quite kind and a dangerous job. For the most part, the pacing of the series is perfect: things happen at a fairly slow rate, but it is always interesting and there is always just the right amount of conflict. Beginning at episode 24, however, the pacing becomes very rushed. Since the TV ratings of this show were quite low, the show was cut short from what was probably set to be about 50 episodes down to 33. The change is awkward and brings the overall quality of the plot down a few notches, but that does not keep the heart of the story from being both sweet and exciting. Sure, it is for kids, and it shows in the blunt narration, and some painfully straightforward episodes. . . but it made me wish that I grew up in Japan just so I could have watched such a wonderful show in my childhood. If you have not been informed yet, there is one thing you should know about the show visually: the only English-language fansubs out there are VHS rips. This should not, however, hinder you from enjoying a visually stunning show! Even through generations of VHS copies, it is still apparent that it is very pretty, to say the least. The character designs in particular are very nice looking: truer to life than most anime yet very cute; fitting for a show for kids yet functional in the most serious of situations. The backgrounds, something I rarely notice, are equally impressive. They are very immersing and really show the viewer that the setting is a real place and not some made-up cartoon setting. Quite frankly, if you pass over this series just because it is from the 90s or because of the nature of VHS releases, you are missing out on something beautiful. Sound is another thing I tend not to notice, but I noticed it in this series. And believe me, that is a good thing. The background music is beautifully fitting of the situations it is used in. Meanwhile, the opening theme song, &quot;Sora E...&quot;, is gorgeous as a standalone song and even better when paired with the opening animation. Furthermore, the lyrics and the mood fit the series well. Finally, the closing theme song, &quot;Si Si Ciao&quot;, is a peppy and happy tune, unusual of EDs and probably the least interesting piece of music in the show, but it is still solid. The cast, like other elements of the series, is extremely likable. Romeo is one of the sweetest children ever to grace anime, and quickly won my heart. The rest of the cast is similarly sweet and likable, but to a realistic degree. Alfredo is selfless; Angeletta is kind... I could go on and on listing the good qualities of the characters, but I will leave it at this: the only flaw most characters have is that they take their good qualities too far (Romeo, for instance, is honest even when dishonesty would be more logical). While sometimes this is a bit much, it largely gives us a unique and endearing cast. Romeo no Aoi Sora is frequently overlooked for shows that look better, sound more exciting, seem more mature, or are simply newer. The few fans that do decide the try out this series, however, will be rewarded with an amazing show. No matter how you look at it, the series is marvelous in every way. If you already like adaptations of books for a young audience, older series, or obscure series, Romeo no Aoi Sora is perfect for you. Even if you do not, however, it is still a miraculous series, one that is highly recommended for anyone who wants something with real heart.

I say this for a number of reasons, the first being that this was clearly not meant to be enjoyable, or funny. Yet from the looks of it, it can be classified as comedy, and it SURPRISINGLY caused me to laugh once, or twice. That is good for an anime that didn't expect to amount to anything. Isn't it? Before I get into the specifics of how bad the anime is, there is good reason to point out that this is the first anime of its kind. An anime solely based on promoting something else, at the end of each episode which only lasts around 3 minutes, if you skip the opening that is, otherwise it is 5 minutes in total. At the end of which a product is shown to the viewer, the product being an app. They even had the audacity to hide the one thing that was remotely interesting within a product that would need to be purchased. That was one of the laughs that this anime had gotten out of me, hilarious. At any rate... Story(1): M.I.A (Missing in Anime) Art(1): The budget must have been outrageously low for this anime, it seems as if the artist followed some sort of anime drawing tutorial, yes you read right, artist as in one single artist, because it would be absolutely ludicrous to think that multiple persons worked in this department. Sound(1): I would hate for you to waste your time watching this anime, so here is some homework for you. Step 1: Obtain a black board and some chalk. Step 2: Apply the ample amount of force to cause screeching. That would be the equivalent of the sound you'll get from Vampire Holmes. Character(1): If this is what can pass for character development nowadays, then YOU are in luck. Submit your resume to Studio! Cucuri, and you will be on your way to becoming a top notch character designer. All kidding aside, the characters are two-dimensional in the physical, and abstract sense of the term. Enjoyment (2): This may shock you, but since the point of me watching the anime was to see how bad an anime can get. I enjoyed it a little.

Fortunately, my cousin showed me this anime and I thought at first it was going to be somewhat bland because the main character, Makunouchi Ippo, does not have any redeeming characteristic about himself; the guy is just too nice. The story revolves around Ippo learning more on unorthodox methods of strengthening his body to be able to overcome his opponent through his coach's teachings. The action on this show makes this, in my opinion, one of the best sports anime ever because the fights scene get so intense because Ippo can never overcome his opponent because they have a new boxing talent or trait that Ippo has to figure out through training to find a way to overcome him. But if you don't just want intense action all the time, there is a small romance that changes up the story, so it's not non-stop fighting. Not just the story, but the characters around Ippo make you laugh hard because they do stupid stuff together that allows Ippo to open up to because he never had people who he could call friends that would hang with him. This anime is one of my all time favorites because what it teaches people about hard work and commit can do for a person. I highly recommend this anime to everyone.
